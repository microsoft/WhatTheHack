# Challenge 04: Injecting Chaos into your CI/CD pipeline

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Pre-requisites
To complete this challenge you will use the Pizza Application or your AKS application


## Introduction
You will need to have an in depth understanding of DevOps and your CI/CD tool of choice.

This is where the rubber meets the road. You will take what you have learned from the previous challenges and apply the knowledge here. 


## Description

You will take the Pizzeria Application or your application and add a chaos experiment to your deployment pipeline.
Run your experiments in Dev/Test, do not run in Prod.


## Tips
1. You want your application to be available (healthy state) during failure.
2. What kinds of faults and remediation come to mind from the previous challenges? 

## Success Criteria

- Show that Chaos Studio injects fault(s) into your application via your pipeline.
- Verify that your application remains healthy during the Chaos Experiment.
