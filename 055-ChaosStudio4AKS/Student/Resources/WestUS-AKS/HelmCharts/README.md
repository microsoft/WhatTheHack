## Setting up Kubernetes

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN THROUGH THE STEPS IN THIS FILE IF YOU ALREADY PROVISIONED AKS. 

The steps to deploy the AKS cluster, scale it up and scale it down are available in the README file for that section: [README](../ARM-Templates/README.md).

You should have not have to do provisioning again since you have already provisioned AKS using the create-cluster.sh script in [Prerequisites >](../../../00-prereqs.md)

## PostgreSQL Setup on Kubernetes

These instructions provide guidance on how to setup PostgreSQL 11 on AKS

This requires Helm3 and the latest version of Azure CLI to be installed. These are pre-installed in Azure CloudShell but you will need to install or download them if you are using a different environment.

## Installing the PostgreSQL Database

```bash

# Navigate to the Helm Charts
#cd Resources/HelmCharts

# Install the Kubernetes Resources
helm upgrade --install wth-postgresql ./PostgreSQL116 --set infrastructure.password=OCPHack8

```

## Checking the Service IP Addresses and Ports

```bash

kubectl -n postgresql get svc

```
**Important: you will need to copy the postgres-external Cluster-IP value to use for the dataSourceURL in later steps**

## Checking the Pod for Postgres

```bash

kubectl -n postgresql get pods

```
Wait a few minutes until the pod status shows as Running

## Getting into the Container

```bash

# Use this to connect to the database server SQL prompt

kubectl -n postgresql exec deploy/postgres -it -- /usr/bin/psql -U postgres

```
Run the following commands to check the Postgres Version and create the WTH database (warning: application deployment will fail if you don't do this)

```sql

--Check the DB Version
SELECT version();

--Create the wth database
CREATE DATABASE wth;

--List databases. notice that there is a database called wth
\l

-- Create user contosoapp that would own the application schema

 CREATE ROLE CONTOSOAPP WITH LOGIN NOSUPERUSER INHERIT CREATEDB CREATEROLE NOREPLICATION PASSWORD 'OCPHack8';

-- List the tables in wth
\dt

-- exit out of Postgres Sql prompt
exit

```

## Uninstalling the PostgreSQL from Kubernetes (only if you need to cleanup and try the helm deployment again)

Use this to uninstall the PostgreSQL 11 instance from Kubernetes cluster

```bash

# Uninstall to the database server. To install again, run helm upgrade
helm uninstall wth-postgresql

```

## Installing MySQL

```bash

# Install the Kubernetes Resources
helm upgrade --install wth-mysql ./MySQL57 --set infrastructure.password=OCPHack8

```

## Checking the Service IP Addresses and Ports

```bash

kubectl -n mysql get svc

```
**Important: you will need to copy the mysql-external Cluster-IP value to use for the dataSourceURL in later steps**

## Checking the Pod for MySQL

```bash

kubectl -n mysql get pods

```

## Getting into the Container

```bash

# Use this to connect to the database server

kubectl -n mysql exec deploy/mysql -it -- /usr/bin/mysql -u root -pOCPHack8

```

Run the following commands to check the MySQL Version and create the WTH database (warning: application deployment will fail if you don't do this)

```sql

-- Check the mysql DB Version
SELECT version();

-- List databases
SHOW DATABASES;

--Create wth database
CREATE DATABASE wth;

-- Create a user Contosoapp that would own the application data for migration

CREATE USER if not exists 'contosoapp'   identified by 'OCPHack8' ;

GRANT SUPER on *.* to conotosoapp identified by 'OCPHack8'; -- may not be needed

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wth.* to contosoapp ;

-- Show tables in wth database

SHOW TABLES;

-- exit out of mysql Sql prompt
exit

```

## Uninstalling the MySQL from Kubernetes (only if you need to cleanup and try the helm deployment again)

Use this to uninstall the MySQL instance from Kubernetes cluster

```bash

# Uninstall to the database server. To install again, run helm upgrade command previously executed
helm uninstall wth-mysql

```

## Deploying the Web Application

First we navigate to the Helm charts directory

```bash

cd Resources/HelmCharts


```

We can deploy in two ways. As part of this hack, you will need to do both ways

* Backed by MySQL Database
* Backed by PostgreSQL Database

For the MySQL database setup, the developer/operator can make changes to the values-mysql.yaml file.

For the PostgreSQL database setup, the developer/operator can make changes to the values-postgresql.yaml file.

In the yaml files we can specify the database Type (appConfig.databaseType) as "mysql" or postgres" and then we can set the JDBC URL, username and password under the appConfig objects.

In the globalConfig object we can change the merchant id, public keys and other values as needed but you generally can leave those alone as they apply to both MySQL and PostgreSL deployment options

```yaml
appConfig:
  databaseType: "databaseType goes here" # mysql or postgres
  dataSourceURL: "jdbc url goes here" # database is either mysql or postgres - jdbc:database://ip-address/wth
  dataSourceUser: "user name goes here" # database username mentioned in values-postgres or values-mysql yaml - contosoap
  dataSourcePassword: "Pass word goes here!" # your database password goes here - # OCPHack8
  webPort: 8083 # the port the app listens on
  webContext: "pizzeria" # the application context http://hostname:port/webContext
```

The developer or operator can specify the '--values'/'-f' flag multiple times.
When more than one values file is specified, priority will be given to the last (right-most) file specified in the sequence.
For example, if both values.yaml and override.yaml contained a key called 'namespace', the value set in override.yaml would take precedence.

The commands below allows us to use settings from the values file and then override certain values in the database specific values file.

```bash

helm upgrade --install release-name ./HelmChartFolder -f ./HelmChartFolder/values.yaml -f ./HelmChartFolder/override.yaml

```

To deploy the app backed by MySQL, run the following command after you have edited the values file to match your desired database type

```bash

helm upgrade --install mysql-contosopizza ./ContosoPizza -f ./ContosoPizza/values.yaml -f ./ContosoPizza/values-mysql.yaml

```

To deploy the app backed by PostgreSQL, run the following command after you have edited the values file to match your desired database type

```bash

helm upgrade --install postgres-contosopizza ./ContosoPizza -f ./ContosoPizza/values.yaml -f ./ContosoPizza/values-postgresql.yaml

```

If you wish to uninstall the app, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash

# Use this to uninstall, if you are using MySQL as the database
helm uninstall mysql-contosopizza

# Use this to uninstall, if you are using PostgreSQL as the database
helm uninstall postgres-contosopizza

```


After the apps have booted up, you can find out their service addresses and ports as well as their status as follows

```bash

# get service ports and IP addresses
kubectl -n {infrastructure.namespace goes here} get svc

# get service pods running the app
kubectl -n {infrastructure.namespace goes here} get pods

# view the first 5k lines of the application logs
kubectl -n {infrastructure.namespace goes here} logs deploy/contosopizza --tail=5000

# example for ports and services
kubectl -n {infrastructure.namespace goes here} get svc

```

Verify that contoso pizza application is running on AKS

```bash

# Insert the external IP address of the command <kubectl -n contosoappmysql or contosoapppostgres get svc below>

http://{external_ip_contoso_app}:8081/pizzeria/
```
