# Challenge 06 - Stress Testing

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-05.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-07.md)

## Introduction

Unlike load testing, which ensures that a system can handle what it's designed to handle, stress testing focuses on overloading the system until it breaks. A stress test determines how stable a system is and its ability to withstand extreme increases in load. It does this by testing the maximum number requests from another service (for example) that a system can handle at a given time before performance is compromised and fails. Find this maximum to understand what kind of load the current environment can adequately support.


## Description

- Create a new set of test scripts or parameters and run a stress test
- Identify the bottlenecks and breakpoints of the application under stress
- Decide whether to add the steps needed to remediate to the backlog #devops

## Success Criteria

- Review your *stress* test scripts and discuss the parameters that are different from a traditional *load* test.
- Show a side-by-side comparison of the load tests results and the stress test results. 
- Discuss the bottlenecks and breakpoints of the application under stress.
- Discuss the steps needed to remediate to the bottlenecks and breakpoints.
