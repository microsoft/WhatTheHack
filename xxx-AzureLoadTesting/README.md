# What The Hack - xxx-AzureLoadTesting

## Introduction
Azure Load Testing Service (Preview) enables developers and testers to generate high-scale load that reveal actionable insights into app performance, scalability, capacity - and ultimately resiliency - with a fully managed service.

## Learning Objectives
This hack is designed to introduce you to Azure Load Testing and guide you through a series of hands-on challenges to accomplish the following:

- Leverage a cloud-based load testing service with high fidelity support for JMeter and new/existing JMeter scripts
- Build a comprehensive view of curated client and server metrics with actionable insights into app performance
- Integrate with CI/CD workflows for automated, collaborative load-testing
- Perform load testing in conjunction with Azure Chaos Studio to ensure resiliency during an application/service/region degradation or failure
