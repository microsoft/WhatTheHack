# Challenge 02 - Build an AI Model to extract Order Data

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Pre-requisites

- An account with access to Power Automate
- Started a free trial of with AI Builder
- A trained AI Builder model or an AI Builder prebuilt model

## Introduction

AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability you can use to bring the power of Microsoft AI to your organization, without the need for coding or data science skills. This challenge involves building an end-to-end process to extract key Order Data from an Order in PDF/Image/Word format to help automate the processing of Orders. 

## Description

In this challenge, you will set up a Model to extract data from a sample Order form so we can use it in the Power Automate Flow.

You can find the sample Order Form in the Challenge2 folder of the Resources.zip file provided by your coach.

Review the sample Order Document and decide whether we can use any prebuilt model that AI Builder offers, or we need to build a custom model to read the information on the form.

The Model is required to:
- Extract General Order Information (Order Number, Order Date, Order Total)
- Extract Customer Information (Full name, Address, Email or Phone)
- Extract Order Detail Information (Product Code, Product Description, Quantity and Unit Price)

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that the Model extracts information from the Order form properly
