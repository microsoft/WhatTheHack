# Challenge 05 - Build a Power App


## Pre-requisites (Optional)

Before you can use Power Apps you need:
	· An account with access to Power Apps
	· Complete challenges 1 - 4

## Introduction

Now that you have managed to processes of handling inbound emails, extracting and storing order data leveraging AI Builder, and creating an approval process, this challenge you will create a Power App to view and manage the order data.

## Description

In this challenge, you will create a Power App to support Order and Customer Management
Once you have created the solution, your team will design an app which will allow a teacher to view attendance and manage student profiles. To get you started, we have provided your team with a canvas app zip file which includes two custom components, a navigation bar, and a title bar. Since the components are generalized, you will have to customize them to include proper icons and labels.
While importing the base canvas app, rename the canvas app to include your team number and specify the development environment. (e.g., Tailspin Toys – Team 2 – Dev).
Now that your base app is imported, implement the following design requirements:
- A working navigation component that allows the user to switch between app screens.  
    - Hint: You will need to add and configure the navigation component from the base solution to the screens that you and your team creates
- Four app screens that show the following:
	· A screen and a label that shows the Customer records view
	· A screen and a label that shows the Order records view for a selected customer
	· A screen and a label that allows for viewing of a selected Order and detail lines
	· A screen that will be used to view analytics (report visualizations will be created in a future challenge)
	· It is your choice as to which fields are displayed on the screens.
	· Include a search box for locating a customer on the customer screen
	· Include a search box for locating an order on the Orders screen
	· Appropriate buttons for navigation, editing/viewing, etc.
	· Connect the above components so that the custom properties in the provided navigation system directs the user to the correct page.


## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
	· Demonstrate a working app to your coach that reads data from the Dataverse and fulfills the above requirements as well as in the solution in your team's development environment.
