[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)


## Pre-requisites

Before you can use:
  - Ensure you have a test environment for which you can import your development solution


## Introduction - Tailspin Toys – Order process automation

Welcome to the Power Platform Basics What the Hack!  It’s time to challenge yourself and work together with a group of 3-5 of your peers to solve the technical challenges below!

Tailspin Toys is a toy and school supplies company. The company sells toy products, party products and different school supplies through its retail locations and the Internet. Tailspin Toys has around 500 stores all over the world and has ten major contracts for school supplies all over USA. The company stores are located in 35 countries. The company owns and operates one website http://www.tailspintoys.com/ that includes an online store. The second biggest market for them is in Poland, Europe so the company opened a subsidiary there.

Subsidiary address: Ul. Dobra, 4321, Warsaw, Poland
Phone number: +48 12 345 67 89
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tailspin toys identified challenges in their supply chain.  Their legacy based order system required on premises hardware that is costly to scale and would eventually become obsolete.  The board has approved investing in a new platform that will automate their order taking; however, due to the limited budget, the solution must have the following properties:
 
	1. Minimal user interface maintenance as much of the experience is delivered via configuration versus outright coding.
	2. Predominantly a low code development platform.
	3. Model-driven apps with tried and tested application lifecycle management options.
	4. Supports a strong and flexible data security model affecting the degree to which users can interact with table records and columns. 
	5. Logic can be introduced to ensure that columns contain the data that adheres to the business rules.
Solution will be maintained by the team via Citizen Developer


## Choose the platform and build environment

Challenge
  
	1. Answer the question:  What platform will you choose and why?
	2. Form a team and assign roles.  Recommended:  Choose a method of collaboration (e.g. OneNote, Teams, etc.
	3. Install requirements for Power Platform.
	4. To begin this challenge, Tailspin Toys would like for your team to create a new solution in your team's development environment. This new solution will serve as a container for the components that your team will be assigned in later challenges. In accordance with application lifecycle management (ALM) best practices, all future work should be created from this solution.
Bonus Challenge: Have the team present to the Tailspin Toys board their platform of choice and why.  Include milestones if confident.
NOTE: This challenge will require license to complete the challenge (trials)
Success Criteria
Learners will provide the coaches with their platform of choice which should be Power Platform.  Learners should detail their team structure, show how they will collaborate, and demonstrate how the environment is setup.   
BONUS:  Learners will deliver this in PPT to the coaches who are the board.
BONUS:  Choose licensing <- Costs associated to solutions
