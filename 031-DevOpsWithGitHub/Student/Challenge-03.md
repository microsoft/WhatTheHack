[< Previous Challenge](Challenge-02.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, there is [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). With GitHub project boards, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, tasks, issues/bugs and features associated with your project.  

Review the following introduction to GitHub project boards: [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).

## Description

- Add collaborators from your team to your repo. 

- Create a new project using the "Team backlog" template.

- Ensure your project is with linked with your repository

- Create a draft issue for this challenge (3) and each of the remaining challenges (i.e., create 9 issues total - skip challenges 0,1 and 2 as you already completed them). When creating each issue, make sure to:
    - Assign an owner for each issue from your team. 
    - Convert the `challenge 3` draft issue to an issue and select our repository. Look at the difference between a draft and your converted `challenge 3` issue

- Move all your issues to the "Ready" column and convert each one from draft to an issue.

- Since you are currently working on Challenge 3, drag the `Challenge 3` issue to the "In progress" column.

- Ask your team member to close the `Challenge 3` issue you assigned to them. Review your project board to see if the issue moved to the 'Done' column automatically. 

- Create a new view to show your challenge issues in a table view. 

- Add a custom field to your issue. The custom field can be called Complexity and will be a single select type with the options (Very Easy, Easy, Hard and Very Hard).

- After you complete each of the following challenges, be sure to close each associated issue. 

## Success Criteria

- You have added one or more collaborators to your repo
- You have a project board using the automation kanban template with 9 issues (8 open, 1 closed by a team member)
- New issues appear under the "New" column
- Closed issues automatically appear under the "Done" column
- You will have a table view in addition to your Backlog Board
- You will have a custom field called Complexity on your issues
