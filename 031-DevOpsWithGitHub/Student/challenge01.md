### Introduction

Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, there is [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards). With GitHub project boards, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, tasks, issues/bugs and features associated with your project.  

Review the following introduction to GitHub project boards: [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).

### Challenge

1. Ensure GitHub issues are enabled for your repo. This will allow you to create issues and put them on the project board. 

2. Add collaborators from your team to your repo. 

3. Create a project board using the "automated kanban" template.

4. Create an issue for this challenge and each of the remaining challenges (i.e., create 8 issues total - skip challenge 0). When creating each issue, make sure to:
    - Assign an owner for each issue. Assign the `challenge 1` work item to another member of your team, have them assign their `challenge 1` work item to you. Assign all remaining challenges to yourself.
    - Associate each issue with the project board you just created 

5. Review the project board and ensure your issues automatically appear under the "To do" column.

6. Since you are currently working on Challenge 1, drag the `Challenge 1` card from the "To do" column to "In progress."

7. Ask your team member to close the `Challenge 1` issue you assigned to them. Review your project board to see if the issue moved to the 'Done' column automatically. 

8. After you complete each of the following challenges, be sure to close each associated issue. 

### Success Criteria

- You have added one or more collaborators to your repo
- You have a project board using the automation kanban template with 9 issues (8 open, 1 closed by a team member)
- New issues automatically appear under the "To do" column
- Closed issues automatically appear under the "Done" column
