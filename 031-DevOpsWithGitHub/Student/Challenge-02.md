# Challenge 02 - Setup a Codespace

[< Previous Challenge](Challenge-01.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

Developer environments are critical to ensuring your development teams are setup to do their best work. Right now everyone on your team likely has a slightly different setup of their environment (editor, extensions, tools) installed on their local machine.

GitHub includes the ability to create a cloud based development environment called a codespace that is configured via a dev container (`devcontainer.json`) code file detailed within a repository. The file details how a developer environment should be supplied consistently from the cloud to every developer in the team who wants to create one in a self-serve manner. This can include the editor, extensions and tools we want to have available. 

Our repository includes an application written in .NET that will deploy to Azure using Infrastructure-as-Code via a language called Bicep. We will want to configure our codespace to have tooling included to work with .NET, ARM (infrastructure-as-code) and the Azure CLI.

## Description

- Add a new devcontainer file in your repository placed in a `.devcontainer` directory that defines your codespace. Ensure your devcontainer file is based on a docker image for .NET, notably "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet:0-7.0" for the hackathon supplied application on .NET 6.0. 

  **NOTE:** - VS Code Dev Containers Extension has a feature here that will simplify this process.

- Configure your devcontainer to add a feature for the Azure CLI.

- Start a new codespace in your repository testing .NET and Azure CLIs are available.

## Success Criteria

- You will have created a `devcontainer.json` placed in a `.devcontainer` directory.
- You have created a codespace to provide a cloud based instance of the environment described in your devcontainer file. 
- Your codespace will have tooling available for both the .NET and Azure CLIs

## Advanced Challenges (optional)
Add to your `devcontainer.json` with details of an extension to install into Visual Studio Code and add a postCreateCommand that will restore NuGet packages for the .NET app in the Application directory of the repo.
