**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- Make sure students dont get the new "Project (Beta)" confused with the traditional Project boards.
- Students wont be able to assign tickets to others if they are not invited and accepted as collaborators.
- Issues and PRs are very similar as they use issues underneath both.

- To add collaborators
    - In your repository, select "Settings"
    - On the left hand side, select "Collaborators"
    - Select "Add people"
    - In the popup, enter the user you wish to add
    - The user will need to accept the invite before this is complete.
- Create Automated Kanban Board
    - In your repository, select "Projects"
    - Make sure on the left hand side you select "Projects", the one not in beta
    - Select "New Project"
    - Fill in the name you want.
    - Select "Automated Kanban" in the template drop down.
    - Select "Create Project
- Creating Issues
    - In your repository, select "Issues" 
    - Select "New Issue"
    - Create the issue for each challenge.  Make sure you link the issue to the project on the right hand side before creating.
    - New issues if linked properly should show up in the "To do" column.  Once you set to closed, it should move to "Done" column.  If you are viewing the issues in the kanban board, you are able to drag the issues across the columns.
