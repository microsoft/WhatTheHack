# What The Hack - Synapse Serverless - General concepts & how to

## Introduction
This "What the Hack" enables attendees to understand how to query their data lake from Synapse Serverless. 
It simulates a real-world scenario where users need to explore data in different files with different formats and the goal is to apply the most important features available in Serverless to properly read and process those data.

During the hack, attendees will focus on:
- Files, data exploration and best practices
- External table
- Delta Files and partitioning
- Spark interaction
- Workload monitoring

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the "Synapse Serverless - Gerneral concepts & how to", attendees will have a good understanding:
- How to easily explore different files with different formats and different authentication methods
- Work with metadata informations and Spark tables 
- Work with Delta files
- Performance best practices 
- Monitor workload
