# Challenge 02 - Time to fix things

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

Now that we have identified some issues, it is time to mitigate them. Based on your findings from the previous challenge, you will need to define a plan to fix most if not all of these issues.

## Description

In this challenge, you will properly configure you Azure Cosmos DB so that it minimizes cost as well as optimizes performance. You will also need to make some changes in the application code itself to take advantage of the changes.

Lastly, you will compare your previous findings on performance/cost with the newer metrics. You will need to re-run the Load Test defined in your Azure Load Testing service.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Define a plan to apply a new data model that mimizes downtime for the application.
- Implement the data model change as well as the application code to the advantage of the improvements.
- Present how the new design has optimized the database and application perfmormance and cost.
