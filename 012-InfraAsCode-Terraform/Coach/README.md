# What The Hack - Infrastructure As Code: Terraform - Coach's Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Infrastructure As Code: Terraform  What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

Also remember that this hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](tbd) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide.  Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack!  Go learn something. :)
