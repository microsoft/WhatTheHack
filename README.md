# What, Why and How

- "What the Hack" is a challenge based hackathon format.
- Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished.
- Challenges are not step-by-step labs.
- Attendees work in teams of 3 to 5 people to solve the challenges.
- Attendees "learn from" and "share with" each other.
- By having to "figure it out", attendee knowledge retention is greater.
- Proctors provide guidance, but not answers to the teams.
- Emcees provide lectures & demos to setup challenges & review solutions.
- What the Hack can be hosted in-person or virtually via MS Teams.
