## Overview

The App Modernization hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end migration and modernization scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and search, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Requirements
