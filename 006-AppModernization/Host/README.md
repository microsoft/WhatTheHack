# Appmodernization Hackathon

## Misc Notes

It's a good idea if everyone participating in the hack use their own Azure Subscription. Sharing one Subscription is possible, but you need to make sure when migrating using Azure Migrate Tool, to use unique names for the App Service and Azure SQL, and also use the same DB credentials listed in the begining.

## Step by Step Guide

There is a detailed Step by Step guide that shows every step of most of the options for each challenge. If you get stuck, the answer is in this guide. This should never be given to a student.
