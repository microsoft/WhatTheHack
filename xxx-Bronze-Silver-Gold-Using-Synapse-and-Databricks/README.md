# What The Hack - Bronze-Silver-Gold-Using-Synapse-and-Databricks

## Introduction

With many customers moving towards a modern three-tiered Data Lake architecture it is imperative that we understand how you can utilize Synapase and Databricks to build out the bronze, silver and gold layers to serve data to Power Bi for dashboards and reporting while also ensuring that the bronze and silver layers are being hydrated correctly for ML/AI workloads.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be solving the common big data archicture issue of bringing multiple data sources together, standardizing them in a Delta format, and serving them up to Power Bi for dashboards and reporting.  You will get hands on with Azure Synapse and Databricks so that you understand the similarities and differences between them and how they both can collaborate on the same data, including Delta technology.

## Challenges

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Understand the basics of Synapse
	 - Understand the basics of Databricks
	 - Understand the Delta Lake Concepts.
- Challenge 01: **[Building out the Bronze](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - Standup and configure the Synapse and Databricks Environments.
	 - Hydrate the Bronze Data Lake
	 - Encrypt all connection details in Key Vault
- Challenge 02: **[Standardizing on Silver](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
	 - Move the data from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer 
	 - Apply Delta Format to the Silver Layer
- Challenge 03: **[Go for the Gold](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
	 - Take data from the Silver Layer and make it business analyst ready
- Challenge 04: **[Visualize the Results](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
	 - Create Power BI Assets to showcase your results
