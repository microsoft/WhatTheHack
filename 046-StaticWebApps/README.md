# Static Web Apps
## Introduction
Web apps have evolved from the days of server-generated HTML to a new world of single page applications (SPAs) backed by APIs. Azure Static web apps offer a convenient way to create SPAs combined with a great developer experience. In this hack we'll explore the core capabilities of static web apps.  

## Learning Objectives
In this hack you will be learning about key features of Azure Static Web Apps, designed to accelerate your app development with a global platform for hosting static content and APIs that supports native integration with CI/CD workflows to build and deploy.

The challenges are best tackled in order until at least Challenge 4. Challenges 5-7 can be tackled in any order. Challenge 5 requires access to your own domain and can be skipped for those that do not have one.
