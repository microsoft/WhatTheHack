# Challenge 0: Prerequisites

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Solution-01.md)

## Solution 

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges, preferably done a few days before the event. Additionally, we have a [presentation](MLOpsLectures.pptx) that can be used to help give a high level introduction to MLOps for the students, at both a general level as well as at an Azure level.  Finally, we have a [data and code](Data_and_Code.zip) set that will need to be uploaded to the Teams channel for the students to download and reference in the upcoming challenges. 

- Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- [Azure Machine Learning service workspace](https://ml.azure.com/) - It is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- Azure DevOps subscription. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).
  - Install [Azure DevOps Machine Learning extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml)    
  
  **NOTE:** Azure ML Workspace must be created first before creating Service Connections.  
- Python Installation, version at least \>= 3.6.5. Anaconda is more preferred for Data Science tasks.
  - Anaconda - <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/>
  - Miniconda - <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>
  - Python - <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
- Visual Studio Code or any Python IDE.
  - Python extensions

**NOTE**: You will need privileges to create projects on the DevOps account. Also, you need privileges to create Service Principal in the tenet. This translates to **Ensure that the user has 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Subscription**.
