# Challenge 2 â€“ Create a Build Pipeline in Azure DevOps

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

The Build pipeline demonstrates the automation of various stages/tasks involved in building an ML model and creating a container image on top of that model. The stages generally constitute creating a project environment, preparing the data, training the model, evaluating the model, registering/versioning the model, and scoring the model generally by containerizing the model.

There are several ways to create a `Build` pipeline. The two most common and popular ways are:
- Using a YAML file that represents the entire pipeline.
- Using the classic GUI pipeline and adding tasks sequentially.

Use whichever approach your team is most comfortable with.

We can setup Continuous Integration (CI) trigger for every `Build` pipeline. The CI pipeline gets triggered every time code is checked in. It publishes an updated Azure Machine Learning pipeline after building the code.

## Description

- Make sure you have setup a new project, imported the code, created service connections, and configured Azure ML Workspace for the project.
- Create a `Build` pipeline.
  - Select the repo that was imported in the previous challenge.
  - Set Agent Pool to `Azure Pipelines`.
  - Set Agent Specification to `ubuntu-18.04`.
- Add `Build` pipeline tasks
  - Add a task to setup environment by using `install_environment.sh` file in `environment_setup/` folder. This will install all the python modules required for the project.
  - Add a task to get Azure ML Workspace connection using `Workspace.py` in `service/code/` folder. This will establish connection to Azure ML workspace by using your workspace details in `configuration/config.json` file.         
  - Add a task to acquire time series transactions data using `AcquireData.py` in `service/code/` folder. This will download and extract the data required to train a forecasting model in the next steps.
  - Add a task to train ARIMA forecasting model using `TrainOnLocal.py` in `service/code/` folder. This will build a model to forecast demand of items from AdventureWorks database.
  - Add a task to evaluate the model performance using `EvaluateModel.py` in `service/code/` folder. This will evaluate how well the model is doing by using evaluation metrics such as R-squared and RMSE(Root mean squared error).
  - Add a task to register the model in Azure ML Model Registry for model versioning using `RegisterModel.py` in `service/code/` folder.    
  - Add a task to score the model, to forecast future transactions using `CreateScoringImage.py` in `service/code/` folder. This will create a scoring file.       
  - Now you are at a point of creating an artifact for your `Release` pipeline. An artifact is the deployable component of your model or application. `Build Artifact` is one of the many artifact types. The following two tasks are required to create `Build artifact` in your `Build` pipeline. 
    - Use Copy Files task to copy files from `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)` to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`.
    - Use Publish Artifact task with `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` as path to publish. 
- Run the `Build` pipeline.
- Review `Build` Outputs - confirm that the model and Azure Container Image have been registered in the [Azure ML workspace](https://ml.azure.com/) in respective registries.

## Success criteria

- An end-to-end `Build` pipeline in Azure DevOps.
- Forecasting model registered with the Azure ML Model Registry.

## Tips

- Finding the path to where Azure DevOps will copy your build artifact is often the hardest part.
  - You can use the following command in a `Bash` task to print all environment variables (which is how predefined variables are passed to your pipeline).
    ```shell
    env | sort
    ```
  - You can use the following command in a `Bash` task to print a `tree` of the filesystem of your build agent.
    ```shell
    find $(Pipeline.Workspace) -print | sed -e "s;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g"
    ```
- Use the [predefined variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic) in Azure DevOps to make your tasks simpler & more robust.
- Make sure you specify the version of Python you want the tasks to use (`Python 3.6`, there is a task for this)
- Use the `Azure CLI` task to run the Python scripts since they need to interact with the `Azure Machine Learning` resource.
