# Challenge 3 â€“ Create a Unit Test Locally and in Azure DevOps

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

Use this challenge to perform tasks to confirm data has been extracted from source and saved in the working directory.

## Description

- Write a Python snippet to validate that AdventureWorks data is indeed downloaded and extracted into `Data/` folder. Do a preview of file count in the data folder. Additionally, you could also pick a csv file visualize the data.

## Success criteria

- Count the number of CSV files extracted into `Data/` folder using a `Python script` in Azure DevOps pipeline. (This can be the same script used in [Challenge-01](./Challenge-01)).    
- Visualizing and exploring the data (using a python visualization library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` or `plotly`).

## Tips
  
- Use the `Python Script` task in your `Build` pipeline to run the unit test.
