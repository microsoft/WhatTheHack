# What The Hack - Dive in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse

## Introduction

![](Student/images/WTH.png)

 Washed by the warm [Leeuwin Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeuwin_Current), the coastal waters of Western Australia are a divers paradise, home to a diverse range of marine life including the world's largest fish, the [Whale Shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark). 
 
 On a more sombre note, these waters have also claimed more than [1400 shipwrecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwrecks_of_Western_Australia). Some of these wrecks are well known, such as the [Batavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavia_(ship)) and the [HMS Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Sydney_(D48)), and are protected archaeological sites. But many are regularly explored by intrepid divers and snorkellers, having become popular tourist attractions.

Margie's Travel is a travel agency specialising in diving holidays. They have heard about Microsoft Fabric, and have asked you to help them build a solution to allow their customers to explore the possibilities of diving some of the shipwrecks of Western Australia. 

 Your task is to use Microsoft Fabric to bring together the data and stories behind these shipwrecks to help boost customer engagement. Margie's would also like to be able to use this data to help customers assess dive conditions a few days before, and as a basis for on-board dive briefings.


## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will 

1. Provision a Fabric Lakehouse and "dive" on in. 
2. "Descend" in to the depths of open data sources including spatial, weather and archaeological to help build a data story behind the shipwrecks of Western Australia.
3. "Land" your data in your Fabric Lakehouse and "surface" with a clean, combined dataset ready for analysis.
4. Make a "splash" and bring your findings to life.
