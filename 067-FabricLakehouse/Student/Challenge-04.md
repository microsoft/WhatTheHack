# Challenge 04 - Make a Splash!

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Introduction

You've found your data, cleaned combined and shaped it into something useful. Now it's time to create your data story!

## Description

Remember the two main criteria? Boost customer engagement through data storytelling and enable assessing the diving conditions both beforehand and on-board. Now we're going to really make a splash with Margie's Travel by bringing your findings to life.

## Success Criteria

A Power BI report is an obvious solution, but you are free to wow our customer with any other creative way of presenting your findings. Interpretive dance anyone?

To complete this challenge successfully, you should:

- Create a report, or other way to portray your findings in a compelling way. Augment your data with additional sources if you wish, such as photos or links to other resources (but please remember to respect copyright!)
- Remember your solution should meet the needs of two distinct audiences: customers and dive crew - the data may be the same, but the presentation might not be.
- You will have 10 minutes to present your solution so make it impactful and succinct!

## Tips

- You can use any format, but a Power BI report is an obvious choice.
- Don't go "overboard" with the PowerPoint.
- A live demo always makes a splash!
- Enrich your pieces of eight with some gold doubloons!  Add some additional data sources to your lakehouse to make your data story even more compelling.
