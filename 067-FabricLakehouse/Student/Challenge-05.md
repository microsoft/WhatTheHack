# Challenge 05 - Giant Stride

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction

You've built a compelling data story! Now it's time to present your findings.

## Description

A good hack always wraps up with a retro, and this hack is no different. You will present your findings to Margie's Travel (i.e., the rest of the group) and discuss what you've learned.

You have 10 mins to present your story. You can use any format you like, but you should be able to demonstrate your data story in action. You should also be prepared to answer questions from the audience.

## Success Criteria

We'll leave this one up to the rest of the group to decide!

## Tips

Remember to tell the story, not just the technology.
