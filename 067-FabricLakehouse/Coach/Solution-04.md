## Notes & Guidance

This challenge is to visualise the data. Power BI is the obvious choice, but if a group wishes to build a dashboard in Excel, or use Power Apps, or React then that is fine too.

Emphasis should be placed on the data story and meeting the requirements.

A good data story will have a clear narrative, and will be easy to follow. It will also be visually appealing, address the specific needs of the audience, and will make good use of the data. Students should be encouraged to use other media (whilst keeping within any licensing terms) such as images, to enhance their story.

## Solution

Data stories are subjective, and there are many ways to visualise the data. As such an example solution is not (yet) provided. If you are a PBI visualization wizard, please feel free to contribute!
