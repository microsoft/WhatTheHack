# Challenge 05 - Giant Stride - Coach's Guide

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-04.md) - **[Home](./README.md)**

## Notes & Guidance

This challenge is about showing value to the customer and reflecting on the day. Although it might be tempting to drop this challenge (especially if time is tight), it's important for the teams to present their work so please try to reserve time to include this activity.

## Coach's Role

How's your acting? BAFTA worthy? Oscar worthy? Well, now's your chance to shine. You will play the part of the customer. Make up a character (CDO, Dive Shop Manager, Salty old sea dog yarr) and make it a fun retrospective. How's your pirate accent?

Allocate time for each team to present their work. Encourage the teams to present their data stories, and to reflect on the day. What went well? What could have gone better? What did they learn? What would they do differently next time?

You might like to award small prizes for the best team, the best presentation, or the best pirate accent, but this challenge is not about winning or losing; it's about reflecting on the day and having fun. It's all about the bubbles we blew along the way.

## Finally
