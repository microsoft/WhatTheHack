# Challenge 02 - The Azure Container Registry

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

Azure Container Registry is a managed registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. You can create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage your container images and related artifacts.

You can use Azure container registries with your existing container development and deployment pipelines, or use Azure Container Registry Tasks to build container images in Azure. Build on demand, or fully automate builds with triggers such as source code commits and base image updates.
