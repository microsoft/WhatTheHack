## FabMedical Overview
In this set of challenges, you will be using an application called _FabMedical_, which is a medical conference website application.  The application consists of two components, *web* and *api*, both of which are written using nodejs.  These components currently run natively.  Over the course of this hack, you will containerize these applications and deploy them to Kubernetes.
