# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Intro To Kubernetes What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox.

## Description

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

### Install Cloud Tools on Your Workstation

- Install the recommended toolset:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - Azure CLI 
        - Update to the latest
        - Must be at least version 2.7.x
        - **NOTE for Windows users:** Install Azure CLI on Windows Subsystem for Linux following the instructions for the Linux distribution you are using in WSL.
        - **NOTE:** If youâ€™re running into issues running Azure CLI command on Windows, disable Global Protect (VPN)
    - Visual Studio Code
- **NOTE:** You can start the next challenge even if this one is still running by using the Azure Cloud Shell.
- **Tip:** You can complete almost all of the challenges with the Azure Cloud Shell!  But be a good cloud architect and make sure you have experience installing the tools locally.

### Student Resources

Your coach will provide you with a `Resources.zip` file that contains resource files you will use to complete some of the challenges for this hack.  

If you have installed all of the tools listed above on your local workstation, you should unpack the `Resources.zip` file there too.

If you plan to use the Azure Cloud Shell, you should upload the `Resources.zip` file to your cloud shell first and then unpack it there.

## Success Criteria

1. You have a bash shell at your disposal (WSL, Mac, Linux or Azure Cloud Shell)
1. Running `az --version` shows the version of your Azure CLI
1. Visual Studio Code is installed.
