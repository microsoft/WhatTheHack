# Challenge \#1 - Getting Started with B2C

[< Previous Challenge](./00-pre-reqs.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./02-susi.md)

## Introduction

You are a cloud engineer at Contoso Manufacturing (CMC). Recently, CMC IT Leadership has become interested in offering a fully feature white-label identity solution to individuals outside of the company. They do not wish to see these identities inside of your primary Azure AD tenant, nor do they want these identities to be used for collaborating in your Microsoft 365 environment.

## Description

As an engineer, you have heard of Azure AD B2C. You know that your tenant will need a globally unique name. You mentioned this as an option to your IT Leadership, and they jumped at the chance to pilot this solution. They have asked you to get a new B2C tenant deployed. 

## Success Criteria

1. You have an Azure AD B2C tenant
1. You are able to switch directories between your B2C tenant and the tenant that contains your Azure subscription
