[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge6.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge8.md)

## Introduction
There is quite a lot of metadata available already in Fabrikam's data catalog. You have received an ask from Chief Data Officer in your organization to have a birds eye view of the catalog. The CDO is looking for information about what sources you have in the environment and the type of data etc.

## Description
With your current Microsoft Purview environment, you are able to see individual metadata about your assets, buisness vocabulary in a glossary and lifecycle of the data. There may be areas which require you to revisit and put some additional work. Things like monitoring the scans, checking which glossary terms are being used or maybe get better understanding of the sources you have scanned before. With Data Insights you can have a single pane of glass view into the catalog. This will give you better understanding of exisiting assets and will provide reports on each section. This information may be valid for you to understand actions which happend in your Microsoft Purview and also understand where there is more work required.

## Success Criteria
- To successfully show the catalog insights to the CDO (Coach)
