# Challenge 0: Pre-requisites - Setup - Coach Guide

[Home](./README.md) - [Next Solution >](./Solution1.md)


## Introduction

Duration: 30 minutes. 

Pre-requisites: There are no specific files/links to be shared for completing this challenge. 

We would recommend 30 minutes or less to accomplish this challenge where usually most attendees are able to complete it within this time quite comfortably. 

Groups creation: This challenge requires creation of two user groups AllUsers and Finance. If MSFT internal subscription is being used to host the hack, attendees can create new Microsoft 365 groups to simulate the AllUsers and Finance group (use a specific prefix or suffix to uniquely identify the groups each attendee creates). Attendees can then add the coaches or co-attendees to the groups they created to test the access permissions later to each others catalog. This is because we are unable to create new users. This approach can then be used to test access permissions in the next challenges. If other subscriptions like MSDN are being used, then new groups and new users can also be tested. 

At the end of this challenge, the attendees should have a good idea on the deployment options that are available in Purview. While you summarize the discussion at the end of the challenge try to also talk about the networking aspects on Purview deployment (as it is not touched during the challenge itself). 

It would also be good to talk to the attendees about the managed resources that get deployed. Also, briefly talk on the platform capacity, how Purview costing works. Touch upon what can be monitored and challenge them with questions about how many Purview accounts should an enterprise have and why. 

By now ensure that the attendees have a good overview of how the collections feature work and how to use it for having security controls in place and how permissions inheritance works.
