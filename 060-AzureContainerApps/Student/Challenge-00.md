[Home](../README.md) - [Next >](Challenge-01.md)

### Introduction

In this challenge, you will set up your local machine and cloud environment with the minimum requirements to complete the challenges that follow.

### Description

We assume you already have an Azure subscription with Owner access. If you don't, you can [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for free. We also assume you have a GitHub account. If you don't, you can [create one](https://github.com/) for free.

- Install the recommended tools:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or have a bash shell at your disposal (Mac, Linux or Azure Cloud Shell)
    - Azure CLI 
        - Update to the latest
        - **NOTE for Windows users:** Install Azure CLI on WSL following the instructions for the Linux distribution you are using
    - Visual Studio Code
        - Azure Container Apps extension (optional)
    - Git
- **Tip:** Although you can complete almost all of the challenges with the Azure Cloud Shell, we recommend that you install the tools locally
- **Tip:** GitHub Copilot can help you learn and write code faster. It is optional, but you can try it out if you like!

### Success Criteria

1. You have a bash shell at your disposal (WSL, Mac, Linux or Azure Cloud Shell)
1. You can log into your Azure subscription with the Azure CLI
1. You can run `git` commands from the command line
