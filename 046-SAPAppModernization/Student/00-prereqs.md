**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./01-SAP-Auto-Deployment.md)

## Introduction

We do have some things to check and setup before we begin.  

## Description

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

- Every team should have an Azure subscription with $650 credit. Any team member can share a subscription with other members by providing contributor access to other team members.
- Each team also requires access to power platform. Atleast one team member should have [M365 E5 subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279)  and add other team members temporarily during the hack. Each team member should have licenses Microsoft Power Apps plan 2 Trail, Microsoft power automate free and Microsoft 365 E5 developer.
- [Challenge 1](./01-SAP-Auto-Deployment.md), the Participant will need an authorization to create or have a Service Principal with the Contributor Role, provided. 
- Challenge 1, one of the participants will require access to the [SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://cal.sap.com) with an appropriate user linked to their subscription. That can be either an S-User given to you by your admin or a so called P-User, that you can create from the SAP community yourself. For the P-User navigate to the [SAP community](https://community.sap.com/), click login and register a new user, activate it using the activation email. Depending on existing relationships to [SAP Universal ID](https://account.sap.com/core/create/landing), you will need to use that password.
- All team members can use default powerapp environment or if your license permits can create other environments.

- All team members can access your Azure resource group.
- You can login to the SAP Cloud Appliance Library with your S- or P-User, which is linked to your subscription.
