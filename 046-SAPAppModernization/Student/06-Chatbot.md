# Challenge 6: SAP Chatbot

[< Previous Challenge](./05-PrivateLink.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./07-EventDriven.md)

## Introduction
Your existing app service front end poses a nice interface into the SAP world. Often they get deployed or embedded into internal enterprise portals for discovery and governance purposes. In the Microsoft eco systems there is no place better than the Teams Client to achieve this. Speaking of Teams: using natural language to query your SAP? Any interested? In this challenge you will implement a bot service that can leverage your existing infrastructure and process OData calls.

## Description


## Success Criteria
- Functional message flow using the simulator (actual deployment to Azure and Teams client cherry on the cake)
- Parameterized SAP OData request and Response using a [Microsoft Adaptive Card](https://adaptivecards.io/)
