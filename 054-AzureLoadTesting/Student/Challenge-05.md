# Challenge 05 - Identify & Remediate Bottlenecks

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)

## Introduction

From our last challenge we should now have load tests running against your environment!  While our load tests are automated now, we need to make sure we review the tests to see if we can identify any bottlenecks or changes in behavior.  From there we can share our findings and work towards remediating the issues.  If your application is hosted in Azure, you can leverage some synergy Azure Load Testing has with the other cloud services. 

## Description

Review your load test results to see where there are potential bottlenecks in your application.  If needed, perform additional tests with different settings to help identity any bottlenecks.  Once you have identified one or more bottlenecks, see how you could resolve the bottleneck and show that the fix resolved the issue.

## Success Criteria

- Show how you found the bottleneck
- Verify that your bottleneck has been resolved.
