# What The Hack - Azure Load Testing

## Introduction
Azure Load Testing Service (Preview) enables developers and testers to generate high-scale load that reveal actionable insights into app performance, scalability, capacity - and ultimately resiliency - with a fully managed service.

## Learning Objectives
This hack is designed to introduce you to Azure Load Testing and guide you through a series of hands-on challenges to accomplish the following:

- Leverage a cloud-based load testing service with high fidelity support for JMeter and new/existing JMeter scripts
- Build a comprehensive view of curated client and server metrics with actionable insights into app performance
- Integrate with CI/CD workflows for automated, collaborative load-testing
- Perform load testing in conjunction with Azure Chaos Studio to ensure resiliency during an application/service/region degradation or failure

## Challenges
- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Prepare your workstation to work with Azure.
- Challenge 01: **[Develop a Load Testing Strategy](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - How to develop a load testing strategy for your application
- Challenge 02: **[Create a Load Testing Script](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
	 - Deploy a sample application and create JMeter scripts to support your load testing strategy
- Challenge 03: **[Create Azure Load Testing Service and Establish Baselines](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
	 - Create Azure Load Testing Service and learn techniques on how to establish baselines for your application
- Challenge 04: **[Enable Automated Load Testing (CI/CD)](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
	 - Incorporating load testing into your CI/CD Pipeline
- Challenge 05: **[Identify & Remediate Bottlenecks](Student/Challenge-05.md)**
	 - Reviewing load test results and identifying bottlenecks
- Challenge 06: **[Stress Testing](Student/Challenge-06.md)**
	 - How to perform stress tests and observing your application behavior
- Challenge 07: **[Load Testing With Chaos Experiment (Resilience Testing)](Student/Challenge-07.md)**
	 - Incorporating load testing and chaos experiments together

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with the fundamentals of load testing
- Azure subscription for creating the Load Testing service and running the sample application
- GitHub or Azure DevOps to automate load testing in your CI/CD pipelines
- [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html) installed on your local machine or in a VM to create your load testing script
- [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
