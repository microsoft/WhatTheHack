- There is a sample action which will run a load test.  The default action will either create or run the existing load test.  It is case-sensitive and the GitHub action looks like it lowercase all the tests.
- GitHub will require another action to create issues while ADO has a built-in functionality to do this.
- Students can use the baseline from their first run in challenge 3 to determine what their pass/fail criteria is.
