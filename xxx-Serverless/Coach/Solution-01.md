# Challenge 01 - Setup - Coach's Guide 

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the `/Student/Resources` folder of this hack into a `Resources.zip` file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.  

As per the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost), it is a good practice to upload the `Resources.zip` file to the "Files" tab of the General channel of the Microsoft Team for the hack event.

- Below is a "DownGit" link that should download and create the `Resources.zip` file for you. However, we have heard feedback that Google Chrome flags "DownGit" as a malicious software link. 

- [Download Resources.zip](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FWhatTheHack%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2F015-Serverless%2FStudent%2FResources)

Always refer students to the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth) for the student guide: [https://aka.ms/wth](https://aka.ms/wth)

**NOTE:** Students should **not** be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. The student guide does **NOT** have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub.
