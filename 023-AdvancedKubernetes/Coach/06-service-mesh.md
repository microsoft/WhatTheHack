[< Previous Challenge](05-gitops.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./07-data-volumes.md)

NOTE: Coaches steps for this challenge are intentionally not included. 

This challenges is intended for the students to install and play with the different service meshes.  Because each of the service meshes change over time, there's not much value to include steps which will be outdated.

Some common observations:
* Istio is feature complete, but almost overwhelming.  It is built on Envoy which is pervasive in the Cloud Native ecosystem
* Linkerd is easy to use and get started.
* Consul is pretty good and has a lot of features.
