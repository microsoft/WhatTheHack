## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 

## Description

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

- Make sure that you have joined the Teams group for this hack. The first person on your team at your table should create a new channel in this team with your team name.
- Login to the Azure Portal
- In a separate window, start the Azure Cloud Shell and list your subscriptions with the Azure CLI
  - Pick either Powershell or Bash based on your preference!
  - We will be running the Azure CLI, if you want to run it on your local machine just make sure you have the latest version.
- We are going to need the Subscription ID (guid format) of the subscription we will be working in.
- **TIP**: We will be using the subscription id many times in this hack. You may want to set a variable to hold it and use it in your future shell commands.
- **TIP**: There are 2 different ways to open the Azure Cloud Shell!

## Success Criteria

1. You have a bash shell at your disposal (preferrably the Azure Cloud Shell)
1. Running `az --version` shows the version of your Azure CLI
