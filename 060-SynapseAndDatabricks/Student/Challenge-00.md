**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Bronze-Silver-Gold-Using-Synapse-and-Databricks What The Hack.  
In this hackathon we will visit an architectural style that is known by many different names:
- Bronze - Silver - Gold
- Raw - Enriched - Curated
- The Medallion Architecture
  
This should be fun! But before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.  
Also, it is imperative that each student has a basic understanding of the foundational tools that will be utilized during this hackathon.  These are listed below in the Foundational Knowledge Section.

## Common Prerequisites

We have compiled a list of common tools and software that will come in handy to complete most What The Hack Azure-based hacks!

You might not need all of them for the hack you are participating in. However, if you work with Azure on a regular basis, these are all things you should consider having in your toolbox.
