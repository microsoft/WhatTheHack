## Notes & Guidance

When it comes to visualizations, there isn't really a wrong answer. The students can try out any metrics and visuals that makes sense to them.
  
The most obvious example looking at the Sales data could be a breakdown of the Product sales by quantity or revenue.  In that case we could use visualizations such as a choropleth map and a treemap.  If they are utilizing customer data, it could be a map of customers by state.
