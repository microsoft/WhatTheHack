# Challenge 8: Enhancing Azure Purview with Atlas API

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge7.md) - [Home](../readme.md)

## Introduction

With rich functionality of Azure Purview, there are still some features which are not available yet in the product and may be revelant in the production deployment. Also, there are some tasks you may have in the environemnt which are not feasible with the typical UX experience in Azure Purview Studio. Atlas API can help you enhance your solution with custom features like custom linage. This will allow you to see linage between assets, even if data procesor you are using is not supported out of the box. Atlas API can be also helpful with automation of repetitive tasks.

## Success Criteria
- Create a custom linage between assets with Azure Databricks as a data processing system.
- Bulk load multiple glossary terms.
- Export metadata to .CSV file for future analysis.
