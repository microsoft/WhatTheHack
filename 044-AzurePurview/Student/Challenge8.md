# Challenge 8: Atlas API usage for unsupported features

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge7.md) - [Home](../readme.md)

## Introduction

With the custom classfiication, we have been able to enrich the metadata and help users search for data more effectively. While this has helped, business users have expressed desire to be able to tag assets with business terms which make more sense for them while they try to use the catalog for finding their assets

In this challenge you will setup a business glossary with terms that have been provided by the business users through a .csv file. Once the glossary has been defined, you will tag assets and attributes using these terms

Ensure that these terms can be used for searching these tagged assets and can also be used as filter conditions for the search

## Success Criteria
- Create a custom glossary
- Tag assets (singly and in bulk) with the defined glossary terms
- Confirm that the newly applied tags can be used to filter the search results

## Extended challenge
