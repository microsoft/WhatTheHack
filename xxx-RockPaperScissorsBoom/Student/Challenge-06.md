# Challenge 06 - Build a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-05.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-07.md)

## Introduction

In a previous challenge we manually deployed the app on Azure. Now with this challenge you will be able to build an entire CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps.

## Description

- Create a Build definition with Azure Pipelines to build your Docker images and push it to your Azure Container Registry (ACR). Furthermore, enable the `Continuous Integration` feature for this Build definition.
- Create a Release definition with Azure Pipelines to run your images on your Azure Web App Service for Containers previously provisioned. Furthermore, enable the `Continuous Devivery` feature for the Release definition.
- Update one file on your `main` branch and commit this change, it should trigger automatically the Build and the Release definitions to deploy the new version of your app.
- Once deployed, test the app as an end-user, and play a game once deployed there.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- In Azure Cloud Shell, make sure `az webapp list` is showing your Azure services properly.
- In Azure Cloud Shell, make sure `az acr repository show-tags` is showing your new container image properly.
- In your web browser, navigate to the app and play a game, make sure it's working without any error and that your update is here.
