## Introduction

It's time for a Rock Paper Scissors Boom! Battle.

## Description

- Update the code of the `ExampleBot` with your custom logic. Modify the `RockPaperScissorsBoom.ExampleBot/Hubs/DecisionHub.cs` to call your new bot implementation.
- Once the bot is up and running, tell us the URL on Teams and we include it in the tournament.
