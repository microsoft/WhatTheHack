# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO! - Coach's Guide 

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

Challenge 0 has two major parts:
- Deploy the eShopOnWeb Azure environment from provided Bicep templates.
- Deploy Datadog into Azure from the Azure portal.

The entire hack can be completed from a browser using the Azure Cloud Shell. 

If students have the prerequisite tools installed on their local workstations, you should encourage them to work from there.  

If the students do not have the tools installed, it will take extra time to do this. Encourage them to use the Azure Cloud Shell to kick off the deployment of the eShopOnWeb Azure environment. They can install the tools on their local workstation while they wait for the deployment to complete.

The eShopOnWeb deployment typically takes 20-25 minutes to complete. 

While the students are waiting for their deployments to complete, you should use the time to lecture and/or provide them an overview of Datadog and how it is integrated into the Azure portal.
