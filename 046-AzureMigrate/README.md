# What The Hack - Azure Migrate

## Introduction

In this hack, you will learn how to assess and migrate a multi-tier application from Hyper-V to Azure. You will learn how to use Azure Migrate as the hub for executing a migration, together with accompanying tools.

## Learning Objectives

After this hack, you will know the role of Azure Migrate and related migration tools and how to use them to successfully migrate an on-premises multi-tier application to Azure.

The estimated time required to complete the core objectives of this hack is 1 day however there are some additional "stretch" goals available, should you wish to undertake them.

## Before you start

Before the hack begins, an on-premises infrastructure hosted in Hyper-V will have been deployed for you. This infrastructure is hosting a multi-tier application called 'SmartHotel', using Hyper-V VMs for each of the application tiers.

During the lab, you will migrate this entire application stack to Azure. This will include assessing the on-premises application using Azure Migrate and migrating the web and application tiers using Azure Migrate: Server Migration. This step includes migration of both Windows and Linux VMs.

As stretch goals, you can undertake assessment of the database tier using Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) and a migration of the database to a PaaS solution using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)
