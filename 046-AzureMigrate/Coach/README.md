# What The Hack - Azure Migrate - Coach's Guides

## Introduction

This Hack is dependent on a pre-built lab environment acting as our on-premises workload. The Lab build is automated, but takes some time to run and needs some post-deployment configuration. Allow time to deploy and ensure the lab is working as expected before the Hack begins see [Lab Deployment](./LabDeployment). 

## Notes and Guidance

- **Make sure no one is left behind**
- If during the hack there is any concept not clear for everybody in a group, try to make participants explain to each other. Intervene only when no participant has the knowledge
- For each challenge, you can ask the least participative members to describe what has been done and why
- Feel free to customize scenarios to match your participants' level: if they are too new to Azure, feel free to remove objectives. If they are too advanced, give them additional ones
