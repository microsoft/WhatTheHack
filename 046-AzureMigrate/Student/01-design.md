[< Previous Challenge](./00-lab_setup.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-discovery.md)

## Introduction

In this challenge you will create a plan for migrating the on-premises workload to Azure.


## Description

This challenge is about learning to plan a migration for a real-world production environment.  As such the following factors should be considered:

- Migration approach
  - Choice of rehost, refactor, replatform, rearchitect or rebuild
  - Awareness of time constraints to complete migration and how that might impact your choices
  - Single or multiple waves
- Target Azure environment
  - Existing infrastructure in Azure
  - New infrastructure that needs to be created/configured before migration
  - Best practices for Azure deployments
  - Configuration of resources post migration
  - What decisions require more information and how can this be gathered?
- Stages of the migration
  - Tools to be used at each stage
  - Dependencies to move to next stage


## Success Criteria

- High level migration plan has been discussed amongst the team and a consensus reached
- Outline plan has been created and shared with coaches covering considerations above
