[< Previous Challenge](./03-prepare.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./05-modernise.md)

## Introduction

This challenge is to complete the migration to Azure.  

## Pre-requisites

Challenge 3 has been completed succesfully 

## Description

During this challenge we'll undertake the migration of the workload to Azure. 
Typically this would involve scheduling a maintenance window and working with application and operations teams to ensure support availability during migration, but we will perform those actions during migration. 
We will also consider post-migration activities to ensure the application is running as expected in Azure and perform a clean up of any resources no longer needed.
We should also consider roll back options should the migration not succeed. 

## Success Criteria

- Complete the migration to Azure
- Have a roll-back option should it be needed
- Verify that the web application is working in Azure and accessible from the public Internet
- Complete additional steps to finalize the migration process
