# Challenge 5: Modernise

[< Previous Challenge](./04-migrate.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction

This is an optional challenge if there is time left over at the end of the hack, or if you would like to complete this in your own time after the hack completes. 

## Description

If you chose to take the rehost approach during challenges 1-4 then this challenge will help you to understand options to migrate from VMs to PAAS services.  This can either be done directly from on-premises VMs or from VMs running in Azure. 

## Success Criteria

- Assess and migrate the database (now in Azure) to Azure SQL Database
- Migrate the Ubuntu-based WAF (now in Azure) to Azure Application Gateway
- Assess the web and application tiers for migration to Azure Application Services
