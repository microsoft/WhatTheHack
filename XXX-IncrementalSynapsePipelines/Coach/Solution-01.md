# Challenge #1: Initial Data Load into the Dedicated Pool - Coach's Guide

[< Previous Challenge](Solution-00.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance
For this challenge it is up to the student of how they want to initially copy the data over.

We do not want them to overengineer this component.  The key is to get the data over and if the distribution of the table is not correct in the Dedicated Pool, they can use CTAS to copy tables / create the correct distribution.  

## Tips

*There are also some SQL scripts to use as a reference for CTAS and select statements with regards to the SQL Dedicated Pool.  They are located in the [Resources Folder](./Resources).*
