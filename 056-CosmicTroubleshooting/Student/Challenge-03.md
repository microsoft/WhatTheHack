# Challenge 03 - Automate Order Processing

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

Currently, Stuff and More Stuff Co. is manually processing and shipping orders to their customers. While not an issue early on, with the new demand and number of customers, they are quickly failing to process orders in a timely manner, creating long wait periods for their customers to get their products. They would like to invest in a way to automatically process their orders.

## Description

In this challenge, you will have to process `CustomerOrder` items automatically, creating processed `Shipment` items in the collection named `shipments`. Each processed `CustomerOrder` item should have a status of `shipped`.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Show that the `Shipments` page in the web application shows data for a user.
- Show that in the `Orders` page, each shipped order has a status of `Shipped`.
