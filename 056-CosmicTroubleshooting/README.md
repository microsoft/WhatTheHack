# What The Hack - Cosmic Troubleshooting

## Introduction

The Cosmic Troubleshooting hack will allow you to upskill in identifying and resolving performance issues in Azure Cosmos DB due to bad design decisions. It follows a real-world scenario (Retail) where the application is facing severe performance issues and needs to be re-architected sightly to take advantage of the full power of Azure Cosmos DB.

We estimate that running this hack end-to-end will take approximately 8 hours, with an Azure cost of about $50 or less.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be diving deeper into Azure Cosmos DB data modelling, monitoring and troubleshooting and in general, applying best practices. You will learn about a lot of Azure Cosmos DB features such as:

1. Partitioning
2. Capacity models
3. Indexing
4. Backup
5. Monitoring and Security
6. Synapse Link
7. Change Feed
8. and probably a lot more

We are expecting students to have the following skills within their team:
- Deep knowledge of Azure Cosmos DB features, both from developer perspective as well as database administration
- Experience with .NET C# coding and patterns
- Basic Azure Synapse Analytics knowledge, including basic Spark and SQL Serverless
