# Challenge 3 - Advanced resource declarations

[< Previous Challenge](./Bicep-Challenge-02.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge>](./Bicep-Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

The goals for this challenge include understanding:
 - How to reference to an existing resource
 - Creating a set of resources based on a list or count (loops)
 - Conditionally deploying a resource

## Description
Create a new Bicep file that add additional blob containers to an already existing storage account created in previous challenges
    
+ You should declare a storage account by referencing an already `existing` storage account created in the earlier challenges. The file must not contain a full declaration of the storage account.
+ The Bicep file will take an array of strings representing container names as an input and use a `for loop` to create containers in the list within the existing storage account.

## Success Criteria

1. Use the Azure portal to verify new containers were added to the storage account.
