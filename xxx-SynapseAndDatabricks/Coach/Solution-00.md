## Notes & Guidance

In preparation for the event, please make sure that the students review [Challenge 0 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO! - Student's Guide](../Student/Challenge-00.md) ahead of time and are familiar with the topics listed in the Foundational Knowledge section.

Also assign your students to squads of 4 persons max and add them to the Team Channels for their respective squads so that they can be utilized on Day 1.  

If you have used the survey described in the coach's README, please utilize the scores when dividing the attendees between squads.

Also review the [Bronze-Silver-Gold.pptx](./Bronze-Silver-Gold.pptx?raw=true) presentation in preparation for the kick off of the first session.
