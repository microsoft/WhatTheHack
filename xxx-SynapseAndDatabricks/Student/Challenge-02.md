# Challenge 02 - Striving for Silver

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

*This page is currently being worked on*

## Introduction

In this challenge we will begin to transform the data we loaded "as is" into the Bronze layer into more "standardized" and "integrated" datasets that are then loaded into the Silver layer.

## Description

Some of the things we try to achive within the Silver layer are
1. __Consolidation and Domain Separation__ - An inportant point to keep in mind is that in the Bronze layer, the data is often organized based on the Source System or source object name, where as in the Silver layer the data is organized by Domain, such as Customer or Product.
2. __Data Type Standardization__ 
3. __Formats Applied__ 
3. __Partitioning and Sharding__ 

## Success Criteria

*Sample success criteria for the IoT sample challenge:*

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that the IoT device boots properly after its thingamajig is configured.
- Verify that the thingamajig can connect to the mothership.
- Demonstrate that the thingamajic will not connect to the IoTProxyShip

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*
