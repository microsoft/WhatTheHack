# What The Hack - Azure Container Apps

## Introduction

[Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/azure/container-apps/overview) (ACA) is an Azure service for hosting containerised applications and microservices on a serverless platform. It is powered by Kubernetes and open-source technologies such as [Dapr](https://dapr.io/), [KEDA](https://dapr.io/) and [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/).

ACA allows you to build Kubernetes-style applications in a fully managed experience aligned to best-practices. It doesn't provide direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs.

It's a great place for anyone to start building container based, microservices solutions.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will learn about the fundamentals of Azure Container Apps, and how they differ from Kubernetes applications. You will learn about specific ACA concepts and how to build and deploy applications for ACA. Finally, you will look at support for things like autoscaling, Pub/Sub, managed identity and monitoring.

- Set up a development environment
- Create your first container app
- Deploy single and multi-container apps
- Automate deployment with DevOps
- Explore traffic splitting and scaling
- Monitor container apps
- Understand authentication and identity with container apps
