# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Azure Container Apps What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

Note that not all of the following prerequisites are required. As long as you meet the requirements listed in the [Success Criteria](#success-criteria) section, you will be able to complete the hack.

## Common Prerequisites

We have compiled a list of common tools and software that will come in handy to complete most What The Hack Azure-based hacks!

You might not need all of them for the hack you are participating in. However, if you work with Azure on a regular basis, these are all things you should consider having in your toolbox.
