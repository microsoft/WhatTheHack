# What The Hack - IntroToAzureRedHatOpenShift

## Introduction

This intro level hack will help you get hands-on experience with Red Hat Opeshift on Microsoft Azure. 

This hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](Coach/Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

## Learning Objectives

[**Needs to change: In this hack you will solve a common challenge for companies migrating to the cloud. You will take a simple multi-tiered web app, containerize it, and deploy it to an AKS cluster.] Once the application is in ARO, you will learn how to tweak all the knobs and levers to scale, manage and monitor it.

1. Deploy an ARO cluster and deploy applications to it
2. Understand key ARO management areas: monitoring, storage, networking, scaling, and Azure service operators
