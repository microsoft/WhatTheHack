# Challenge 09 - Azure Active Directory Integration

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-08.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-10.md)

## Introduction
You're also able to authenticate your cluster with Azure AD! So in this challenge, we will be integrating Azure AD into our ARO cluster so we can login with Microsoft credentials. 

## Description
In this challenge, we will be integrating Azure Active Directory with ARO so that Azure AD can be configured as authentication for our cluster. 
- **HINT:** To do this, you will need to create an Azure AD application registration for authentication, and keep track of different values to configure from the Azure Portal to the ARO portal.

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrate Azure AD option on login screen
- Demonstrate logging in with Azure AD successfully
