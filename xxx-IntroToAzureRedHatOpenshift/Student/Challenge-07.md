# Challenge 07 - Scaling

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-06.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-08.md)

## Introduction
OpenShift allows users to scale the number of pods for each part of an application as needed. Looking at the deployment definition we have, we stated that we only want one pod to start with. Let's try and change that! 

## Description
In this challenge, we will be scaling up the number of pods that we have running.

## Success Criteria
To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Demonstrate that more than one pod is up and running using `oc get pods` command or in the portal
