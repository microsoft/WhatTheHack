During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tailspin toys identified challenges in their supply chain.  Their legacy based order system required on premises hardware that is costly to scale and would eventually become obsolete.  The board has approved investing in a new platform that will automate their order taking; however, due to the limited budget, the solution must have the following properties:
 
- Minimal user interface maintenance as much of the experience is delivered via configuration versus outright coding.
- Predominantly a low code development platform.
- Model-driven apps with tried and tested application lifecycle management options.
- Supports a strong and flexible data security model affecting the degree to which users can interact with table records and columns. 
- Logic can be introduced to ensure that columns contain the data that adheres to the business rules.
- Solution will be maintained by the team via Citizen Developer
