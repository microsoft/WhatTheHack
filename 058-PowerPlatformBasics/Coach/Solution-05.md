## Notes & Guidance

- Leverage the completed app in a Coach's environment
- Students will import the starter app and they should add to their solution
- Starter app has components to use to build their screens
- They should add nav icons to the component
- Good practice is to create a screen with the components, subsequent screens could be jump-started by duplicating
- Customer screen should have a select icon to nav to customer detail screen with sub-gallery to orders
- Order screen with detail lines
