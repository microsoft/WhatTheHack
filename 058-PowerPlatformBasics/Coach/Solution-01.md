## Notes & Guidance

Environment setup guidance

Deliveries of this hack may be two different options

Option 1:
- Ensure they create a Power Platform trial - with a database

Option 2:
- Create trial environments using PowerShell script and provide participants with the generated credentials

Additional guidence:
- Ensure users use in-private/incognito or create a new profile in their browser (do not use the default browser to create a new environment as it will conflict with their work O365 login)
- Do not use your corporate license/environment for the hack
- Create a unique tenant name such as: ppwth2022TeamXX

- If Microsoft employees and Partners have access to CDX, we recommend they still follow the trial setup process
- A Power Platform Developer environment would only be advised for a single person attempting the challenges

- Refer to [tenant setup docs](./Solutions/TenantSetup_Coach.pdf) for more information
