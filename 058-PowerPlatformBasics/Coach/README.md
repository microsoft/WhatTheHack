# What The Hack - Power Platform Basics - Coach Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the Power Platform Basics What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

This hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx?raw=true) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Coach Prerequisites

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. Please review the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any What The Hack event, including how to properly configure Microsoft Teams.

We reccommend that coaches provision or leverage their own environment and import the completed solution for reference

### Student Resources

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the `/Student/Resources` folder of this hack into a "Resources.zip" file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.

Always refer students to the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth) for the student guide: [https://aka.ms/wth](https://aka.ms/wth)

**NOTE:** Students should **not** be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. The student guide does **NOT** have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub.

## Suggested Hack Agenda

This hack is designed to be run as a 2-3 day event. It is okay to run this hack as a shorter event and have students cover the core learning objectives by completing at least Challenges 1 through 5.

Challenges 1-5 build upon each other and must be completed in order.  Challenges 6 through 8 are not interdependent. Once a student completes Challenges 1 through 5, they can "choose their own adventure" by doing 6, 7, or 8 in any order they wish.

Challenge 9 involves re-packaging the work a student completes in any or all of the previous challenges. Students can attempt challenge 9 after the first five have been completed, or after 6,7, or 8 are completed.

The below is a rough estimate of how long we have observed these challenges to take. However, no two groups will take the same amount of time to complete the challenges.  It will totally vary based on the skillset of the students.  This is only a sample suggested agenda. 

- Sample Day 1
  - Challenge 1 (50 minutes)
  - Challenge 2 (30 mins)
  - Challenge 3 (2 hours)
  - Challenge 4 (90 mins)
  - Challenge 5 (2 hours)
- Sample Day 2
  - Challenge 6 (45 mins)
  - Challenge 7 (90 mins)
  - Challenge 8 (1 hour)
  - Challenge 9 45 mins)
