*If your hack does NOT contain any lecture presentations, remove this next paragraph.*

This hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Student Resources

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the `/Student/Resources` folder of this hack into a "Resources.zip" file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.

**NOTE:** The student guide does NOT have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub. Students should not be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack.

## Coach Prerequisites 

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event.

These pre-reqs should be shared with a stakeholder in the organization that will be providing the Azure subscription(s) that will be used by the students.

*Please list both technical pre-reqs and Azure subscription pre-reqs.* 

*For example:*

*- Azure resources that will be consumed by a student implementing the hack's challenges*
*- Azure permissions required by a student to complete the hack's challenges.*
*- Any pre-event setup steps a coach would be required to set up such as, creating or hosting a shared dataset, or deploying a lab environment*

- Sample Day 1
 *- Challenge 1 (1 hour)*
 *- Challenge 2 (30 mins)*
