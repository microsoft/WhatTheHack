## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the ${nameOfChallengeArg} What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

*If your hack does NOT contain any lecture presentations, remove this next paragraph.*

This hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Coach Prerequisites 

**NOTE:** The student guide does NOT have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub. Students should not be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. 

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the `/Student/Resources` folder of this hack into a "Resources.zip" file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.

*If your hack has any additional pre-reqs that a coach needs to know before hosting an event, cover them in this section.  This includes both technical pre-reqs, and Azure Subscription pre-reqs.*

<i>
For example, list out:
	- Azure resources that will be consumed by a student implementing the hack's challenges (and how/if to deal with any quota limits that need to be adjusted in the student's subscription).
	- Azure permissions required by a student to complete the hack's challenges.
	- Any pre-event setup steps a coach would be required to set up such as:
		- Creating or hosting a shared dataset
		- Deploying a lab environment
	- If the hack requires a demo Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365 tenant to be provisioned
	- If the hack requires Global Admin access to an Azure AD tenant
