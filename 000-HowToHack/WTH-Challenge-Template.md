*This is a template for a single challenge. The italicized text provides hints & examples of what should or should NOT go in each section.  You should remove all italicized text and replace with your content.*

## Pre-requisites (Optional)

*Your hack's "Challenge 0" should cover pre-requisites for the entire hack, and thus this section is optional and may be omitted.  If you wish to spell out specific previous challenges that must be completed before starting this challenge, you may do so here.*

## Introduction

*This section should provide an overview of the technologies or tasks that will be needed to complete the this challenge.  This includes the technical context for the challenge, as well as any new "lessons" the attendees should learn before completing the challenge.*

*Optionally, the coach or event host is encouraged to present a mini-lesson (with a PPT or video) to set up the context & introduction to each challenge. A summary of the content of that mini-lesson is a good candidate for this Introduction section*

*For example:*

*When setting up an IoT device, it is important to understand how 'thigamajigs' work. Thigamajigs are a key part of every IoT device and ensure they are able to communicate properly with edge servers. Thigamajigs  require IP addresses to be assigned to them by a server and thus must have unique MAC addresses. In this challenge, you will get hands on with a thigamajig and learn how one is configured.*

## Description

*This section should clearly state the goals of the challenge and any high-level instructions you want the students to follow. You may provide a list of specifications required to meet the goals. If this is more than 2-3 paragraphs, it is likely you are not doing it right.*

***NOTE:** Do NOT use ordered lists as that is an indicator of 'step-by-step' instructions. Instead, use bullet lists to list out goals and/or specifications.*

***NOTE:** You may use Markdown sub-headers to organize key sections of your challenge description.*

*Optionally, you may provide resource files such as a sample application, code snippets, or templates as learning aids for the students. These files are stored in the hack's \`Student/Resources\` folder. It is the coach's responsibility to package these resources into a Resources.zip file and provide it to the students at the start of the hack.*

***NOTE:** Do NOT provide direct links to files or folders in the What The Hack repository from the student guide. Instead, you should refer to the Resource.zip file provided by the coach.*

***NOTE:** As an exception, you may provide a GitHub 'raw' link to an individual file such as a PDF or Office document, so long as it does not open the contents of the file in the What The Hack repo on the GitHub website.*

***NOTE:** Any direct links to the What The Hack repo will be flagged for review during the review process by the WTH V-Team, including exception cases.*

*Sample challenge text for the IoT Hack Of The Century:*

*In this challenge, you will properly configure the thigamajig for your IoT device so that it can communicate with the mother ship.*


*You can find a sample thingamajig.config file in the \`/ChallengeXX\` folder of the Resources.zip file provided by your coach. This is a good starting reference, but you will need to discover how to set exact settings.*

*Please configure the thigamajig with the following specifications:*
- Use dynamic IP addresses
- Only trust the following whitelisted servers: "mothership", "IoTQueenBee" 
- Deny access to "IoTProxyShip"

*You can view an architectural diagram of an IoT thingamajig here: [Thingamajig.PDF](/Student/Resources/Architecture.PDF?raw=true).*

*Success criteria goes here. This is a list of things an coach can verfiy to prove the attendee has successfully completed the challenge.*
