## Notes & Guidance

- Students should be able to generate test cases and documentation.  This can either be done via Copilot Chat by asking in a prompt or by highlighting and right clicking a section and choosing "Generate Tests" or "Generate Docs" from the Copilot menu.
- Students can also ask Copilot Chat to update the pipeline as well.
- In either of these scenarios they can start typing in their IDE and have Copilot assist as well.
