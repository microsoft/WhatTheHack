[< Previous Solution](./Solution-01.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- In the previous challenge we let the students explore and experiment.  While they may have noticed a few of these strategies we want to make sure we cover these best practices to ensure they have a good experience and know how to work with Copilot.
  - They should be setting the stage for the new feature, describing at a high level what they are trying to do.  Note, if they want they may even get ideas for new features from Copilot.  Setting the stage gives Copilot context for our long term goals.
  - Keep it simple and specific - Now that we have a high level goal, we can't have Copilot write out the entire thing as there may be too much.  Lets break things down to smaller chunks and have Copilot assist us
  - Examples are great when you have a dataset or schema that Copilot wasn't aware of.  You can even have Copilot learn about some custom module that you may have internally.
- Note that they may not be able to try all examples in their feature implementation.  They can just test it out with sandbox code.
- Some ideas of features
  - Allow multiple players
  - Include a top score board
  - Add a difficulty settings
