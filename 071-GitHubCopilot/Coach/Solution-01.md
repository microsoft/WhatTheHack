# Challenge 01 - Introduction to GitHub Copilot - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-00.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- We give the students 2 options to do the hack. A language they are familiar with or a new language. This is because these are two very common scenarios that we see developers leverage Copilot for.
  - A developer who is focused on a specific language can see how Copilot can assist them with their daily tasks such as boilerplate code.
  - A developer who switches languages or may be learning a new language can see how Copilot can help with that transition.
- GitHub Copilot Chat is extremely powerful and can cover the majority of this challenge on its own in a few prompts. A simple prompt of "Can you help me create a Whack-a-Mole game in *insert language* with the following requirements *insert requirements*" will do all or most of the work for them. More likely than not, they will need to tweak the results but a good portion of it is created. We do want them to interact with Copilot a bit more. They are open to add features if they need more content to go through all the scenarios below or just generate sandbox code that will be deleted later. There are solutions in 3 different languages in the coaches solutions section. These are just meant as guides if you are not familiar with a language. They do not help from the Copilot point of view.
- The students do not need to build some intense UI for this, it could be in ascii if they want it to be. There are not strict requirements so some games may look slightly different.
- **Recommended: Go through all interaction methods below once everyone has completed** - Some students may not be aware of all the different ways to interact with Copilot. Demonstrating each method helps ensure everyone knows their options.
- Ways to interact with GitHub Copilot:
  - **Inline Completions** - Ghost text as you type, `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` for up to 10 suggestions
  - **Copilot Chat Panel** - Dedicated chat sidebar for conversational assistance
  - **Inline Chat** - `Ctrl/Cmd + I` to edit code in-place
  - **Quick Chat** - `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I` for quick questions
  - **Context Menu** - Right-click → Copilot for Fix, Explain, Generate Docs, Generate Tests
  - **Sparkle Icon (✨)** - Context-aware AI assistance throughout VS Code UI
