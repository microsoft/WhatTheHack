# Challenge 01 - Introduction to GitHub Copilot - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-00.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- We give the students 2 options to do the hack.  A language they are familiar with or a new language.  This is because these are two very common scenarios that we see developers leverage Copilot for.
  - A developer who is focused on a specific language can see how Copilot can assist them with their daily tasks such as boilerplate code.
  - A developer who switches languages or may be learning a new language can see how Copilot can help with that transition.
- GitHub Copilot Chat is extremely powerful and can cover the majority of this challenge on its own in a few prompts.  A simple prompt of "Can you help me create a Whack-a-Mole game in *insert language* with the following requirements *insert requirements*" will do all or most of the work for them.  More likely than not, they will need to tweak the results but a good portion of it is created.  We do want them to interact with Copilot a bit more.  They are open to add features if they need more content to go through all the scenarios below or just generate sandbox code that will be deleted later.  There are solutions in 3 different languages in the coaches solutions section.  These are just meant as guides if you are not familiar with a language.  They do not help from the Copilot point of view.
- The students do not need to build some intense UI for this, it could be in ascii if they want it to be.  There are not strict requirements so some games may look slightly different.
- Some ways to interact with Copilot
  - Copilot Chat
  - Copilot within the IDE as they write code
  - Inline chat, you can do this by right clicking at a specific line and selecting Copilot then choosing an option there
  - Ctrl + enter - Copilot can provide longer and up to 10 suggestions
