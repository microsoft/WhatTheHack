# Challenge 05 - Debugging and Code Optimization with Copilot - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-04.md) - **[Home](./README.md)**

## Notes & Guidance

- Students can grab a file of their choice from the [OWASP Juice Shop Repo](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop).  For example you can choose the order.ts file located under routes folder [here](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/routes/order.ts).
- Students should be able to use Copilot chat to ask what the whole file does or highlight and interact with Copilot to explain a snippet of code.
- Asking Copilot Chat should also give them the ability to request for a code snippet to resolve the vulnerability as well.
- Please remind students that while Copilot can find vulnerabilities as we will see here, we should not assume it catches everything.  This is not a replacement for other security tools such as static code analysis tools (CodeQL).
- Since this is a known vulnerable application, we do not expect them to fix and checkin the changes.  This is just an exercise to see how Copilot can help you understand
  - What the file or piece of code is doing
  - Find and resolve vulnerabilities
  - Find and optimize your code
 
- As an added note, you can discuss with your students on other similar scenarios and how this could be useful such as refactoring or code conversion.
