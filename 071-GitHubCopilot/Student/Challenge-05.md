# Challenge 05 - Debugging and Code Optimization with Copilot

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** 

## Introduction
In this final challenge, you'll harness the power of GitHub Copilot to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in a pre-written code snippet. You will also optimize your code, refining its performance and maintainability based on the intelligent suggestions provided by Copilot. This challenge is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of how Copilot can be an integral part of your debugging and code optimization processes.

Please note, while GitHub Copilot can identify vulnerabilities and filter out security vulnerabilities in its suggestions [Link](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/), it does not replace traditional security tools such as GitHub Advanced Security which have more robust capabilities at identifying vulnerabilities. 

## Description
This challenge is centered around enhancing your debugging and code optimization skills with the help of GitHub Copilot. We will be using the codebase from [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) which is an intentionally insecure web application.  You do not need to grab the entire application for this challenge, you may select one of the many files in the routes directory instead. Your tasks are to:

- **Understand the Code**: Sometimes, understanding what a piece of code does is as crucial as writing it. Use Copilot to explain complex code sections, ensuring you comprehend what your code is doing and why.
- **Identify and Fix Bugs**: Leverage the conversational interface to receive guidance on identifying and fixing these bugs.
- **Optimize the Code**: After rectifying the bugs, focus on optimizing the code. Ask Copilot for suggestions on how to improve the efficiency, readability, and performance of your code.

Through this process, you'll not only refine your code but also deepen your understanding of how Copilot can assist in various stages of the development lifecycle, from debugging to code explanation.

## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

1. Have used Copilot to effectively identify and resolve bugs in the provided code snippet.
2. Can demonstrate code optimization improvements suggested by Copilot.
3. Can articulate how Copilot helped in understanding complex parts of the code, shedding light on the 'why' and 'how' behind certain code segments.
