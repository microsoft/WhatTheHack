# Challenge 03 - Extending GitHub Copilot with Model Context Protocol

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction
GitHub Copilot is a powerful coding assistant, but what if you could make it even smarter by connecting it to external tools, databases, or APIs? This challenge introduces you to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows you to extend Copilot's capabilities by integrating both custom context sources and tools. You'll also explore custom agent instructions and chat modes to personalize your Copilot experience for your specific development needs.

## Description
The Model Context Protocol enables GitHub Copilot to connect to external data sources and tools, providing both richer context and executable capabilities for more relevant suggestions and actions. Combined with custom agents and specialized chat modes, you can create a truly tailored coding assistant. In this challenge, you will:

- **Understand MCP Fundamentals**: Learn what the Model Context Protocol is and how it enables GitHub Copilot to access external context and tools beyond your codebase
- **Set Up a GitHub Repository**: Create a GitHub repository for your Whack-a-Mole project and populate it with sample issues, labels, and other GitHub resources to practice GitHub MCP queries
- **Configure the GitHub MCP Server**: Set up and connect the GitHub MCP server to provide GitHub Copilot with access to your GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, and other GitHub resources
- **Create Custom Agent Instructions**: Define custom instructions that guide how GitHub Copilot behaves and responds to your specific project needs
- **Build a Custom Chat Mode**: Create your own custom chat mode that leverages MCP and agent instructions to provide specialized assistance for your development workflow
- **Apply to Your Project**: Use your MCP-enhanced Copilot setup to add a new feature to your Whack-a-Mole game or solve a complex coding challenge

This challenge demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can be customized and extended beyond its default capabilities, making it an even more powerful member of your development team.

## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

- Show a GitHub repository with your Whack-a-Mole code and at least 5 sample issues with different labels
- Demonstrate a working GitHub MCP server connection that provides access to your GitHub repository resources within Copilot
- Show custom agent instructions that modify Copilot's behavior for your project
- Demonstrate a custom chat mode you've built that provides specialized functionality for your development workflow
- Demonstrate using your MCP-enhanced Copilot to query information from your GitHub repo (such as listing issues, checking issue details, or accessing repository information)
