# Challenge 04 - Customizing GitHub Copilot in Your IDE

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Introduction
GitHub Copilot becomes significantly more useful when it understands the context, standards, and expectations of your project. In this challenge, you will customize Copilot within your IDE using custom agent instructions and then use chat modes to interact with Copilot in different ways.


## Description
GitHub Copilot can be customized within the IDE in multiple ways. Custom instructions define behavior that applies across multiple Copilot interactions, while chat modes provide optional, selectable ways to interact with Copilot for specific tasks.

In this challenge, you will define custom instructions to guide GitHub Copilot’s behavior across your project, and then use chat modes to interact with Copilot in more focused, task-oriented ways.

In this challenge you will:

- **Create Custom Instructions**  
  Define custom instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that guide Copilot’s behavior across all Copilot interactions, such as coding style, architectural preferences, or project-specific assumptions.

- **Use Chat Modes in the IDE**  
  Install and select a chat mode from the [Awesome Copilot collection](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main), then use it in the IDE to create a more focused interactive experience while working in the codebase.


## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

- Show a custom instructions file and explain how it guides GitHub Copilot’s behavior across all interactions
- Demonstrate a chat mode installed from the Awesome Copilot collection and selected in the IDE
- Show Copilot responding in a way that reflects your custom instructions
