## Notes & Guidance

The Coach should zip up the `/Student/Resources` directory as a "Resources.zip" file and give it to the students. It contains all of the source code files.

The most common errors are not installing all the prerequisites or credential problems due to having to connect to several different services (Azure, Azure Container Registy, Azure Kubernetes Service, kubectl, etc)
