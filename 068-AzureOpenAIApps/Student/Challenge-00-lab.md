# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO! (Lab Provided)

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Azure Open AI Apps What The Hack. An Azure lab environment will be provided to you with the sample application resources pre-deployed into Azure. Before you can hack, you will still need to set up some prerequisites.

## Description

In this challenge, you will setup the necessary pre-requisites and environment to complete the rest of the hack, including:

- [Access Azure Subscription](#access-azure-subscription)
- [Setup Development Environment](#setup-development-environment)
  - [Use GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces)
  - [Use Local Workstation](#use-local-workstation)
- [Setup Citrus Bus Application](#setup-citrus-bus-application)
  - [Get Azure Resource Settings](#get-azure-resource-settings)
  - [Setup App Backend and Frontend](#setup-app-backend-and-frontend)
    - [Setup App Backend](#setup-app-backend)
    - [Setup App Frontend](#setup-app-frontend)

### Access Azure Subscription 

You will be provided login credentials to an Azure subscription to complete this hack by your coach. When you receive your credentials, make note of them and login to the Azure Portal:
- [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

Keep your credentials handy as you will also need them to login to the Azure CLI (command line interface).

### Setup Development Environment 

You will need a set of developer tools to work with the sample application for this hack. 

You can use GitHub Codespaces where we have a pre-configured development environment set up and ready to go for you, or you can setup the developer tools on your local workstation.

A GitHub Codespace is a development environment that is hosted in the cloud that you access via a browser. All of the pre-requisite developer tools for this hack are pre-installed and available in the codespace.

- [Use GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces)
- [Use Local Workstation](#use-local-workstation)

**NOTE:** We highly recommend using GitHub Codespaces to make it easier to complete this hack.

#### Use Github Codespaces

You must have a GitHub account to use GitHub Codespaces. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can [Sign Up Here](https://github.com/signup).

GitHub Codespaces is available for developers in every organization. All personal GitHub.com accounts include a monthly quota of free usage each month. GitHub will provide users in the Free plan 120 core hours, or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month.

You can see your balance of available codespace hours on the [GitHub billing page](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary).

The GitHub Codespace for this hack will host the developer tools, sample application code, configuration files, and other data files needed for this hack. Here are the steps you will need to follow:

- A GitHub repo containing the student resources and Codespace for this hack is hosted here:
  - [WTH Azure OpenAI Apps Codespace Repo](https://aka.ms/wth/openaiapps/codespace/)
  - Please open this link and sign in with your personal Github account. 

**NOTE:** Make sure you do not sign in with your enterprise managed Github account.

- Once you are signed in, click on the green "Code" button.
- Then click the three dots in the "Codespaces" section and select "New with Options...".
  - We recommend selecting 4-cores for "Machine Type, if possible.
- Finally, click "Create Codespace".

Your Codespace environment should load in a new browser tab. It will take approximately 3-5 minutes the first time you create the codespace for it to load.

- When the codespace completes loading, you should find an instance of Visual Studio Code running in your browser with the files needed for this hackathon.

Your developer environment is ready, hooray! Skip to section: [Setup Citrus Bus Application](#setup-citrus-bus-application)

**NOTE:** GitHub Codespaces time out after 20 minutes if you are not actively interacting with it in the browser. If your codespace times out, you can restart it and the developer environment and its files will return with its state intact within seconds. If you want to have a better experience, you can also update the default timeout value in your personal setting page on Github. Refer to this page for instructions: [Default-Timeout-Period](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces#setting-your-default-timeout-period) 

**NOTE:** Codespaces expire after 30 days unless you extend the expiration date. When a Codespace expires, the state of all files in it will be lost.

#### Use Local Workstation

**NOTE:** You can skip this section and continue on to "Setup Sample Application" if are using GitHub Codespaces!

If you want to setup your environment on your local workstation, expand the section below and follow the requirements listed. 

<details markdown=1>
<summary markdown="span">Click to expand/collapse Local Workstation Requirements</summary>

#### Student Resources

The sample application code, Azure deployment scripts, and sample data sources for this hack are available in a Student Resources package.

- [Download and unpack the Resources.zip](https://aka.ms/wth/openaiapps/resources) package to your local workstation.

The rest of the challenges will refer to the relative paths inside the `Resources.zip` file where you can find the various resources to complete the challenges.

#### Set Up Local Dev Container

You will next be setting up your local workstation so that it can use dev containers. A Dev Container is a Docker-based environment designed to provide a consistent and reproducible development setup. The VS Code Dev Containers extension lets you easily open projects inside a containerized environment. 

**NOTE:** On Windows, Dev Containers run in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). As of May 2025, WSL on Windows ARM64 does not currently support running the Azure Function Core Tools needed for this hackathon in x86_64 emulation using QEMU. IF you are using a Windows on ARM device, you will need to use a GitHub Codespace instead.

On Windows and Mac OS (**NOTE:** only tested on Apple Silicon):
- Download and install Docker Desktop
- (Mac OS only) In Docker Desktop settings, choose Apple Virtualization Framework for the Virtual Machine Manager. Also, click the checkbox to use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon
- (Windows only) Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux along with a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. You will need to copy the `Resources.zip` to your Linux home directory and unzip it there. 
- Open the root folder of the Student resource package in Visual Studio Code
- You should get prompted to re-open the folder in a Dev Container. You can do that by clicking the Yes button, but if you miss it or hit no, you can also use the Command Palette in VS Code and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

### Setup Citrus Bus Application

Contoso Yachts, Inc has developed the Citrus Bus application in-house. The Citrus Bus application supports the company's travel agents with virtual assistants that answer questions about the Contoso Islands and can book yacht reservations. The application also supports Contoso Island educators with advanced AI services that help them grade student tests.

The Citrus Bus application was developed using Python and Typescript/Javascript, and implements a RAG architecture with Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and other Azure AI platform services. These services, as well as frameworks such as Langchain, have support for both Typescript and Python.

There are three major steps to setup the Sample Application:
- [Get Azure Resource Settings](#get-azure-resource-settings)
- [Setup App Backend](#setup-app-backend)
- [Setup App Frontend](#setup-app-frontend)

In your codespace, or student `Resources.zip` package, you fill find the following folders containing the frontend and backend API of the sample application to help you get started:
- `/ContosoAIAppsBackend` - Contains an Azure function app that provides capabilities of processing data and interacting with Azure AI  Services like Azure OpenAI and Azure Document Intelligence.
- `/ContosoAIAppsFrontend` - Contains an Angular App that provides a user interface to some example virtual assistants.
- `/artifacts` - Contains various artifacts and data sources that will be used by the Citrus Bus application
- `/infra` - Contains deployment script and Bicep templates to deploy Azure resources for hosting the Citrus Bus application in Azure.

The apps also contain helper utilities, functions and tools to help you speed up development as well as hints to the challenges you will be taking on.

#### Get Azure Resource Settings

The Azure lab environment has the Citrus Bus application resources pre-deployed into Azure. We have provided you with a script that will load the Azure resource settings into a local settings file that you will use during the hack.  

You can find this script in the `/infra` folder of your Codespace or Student resources package.

The deployment script uses the Azure CLI to log into your Azure subscription. When prompted for Azure credentials, use the ones provided by your coach for the Azure lab environment.

Execute the following commands in the terminal of your GitHub Codespace or local workstation terminal window:

```bash
cd infra
chmod +x genlocalsettings.sh
./genlocalsettings.sh --resource-group-name "openai-apps-wth"
```

To confirm that the script executed successfully, you should find a new file named **`local.settings.json`** in the **`/ContosoAIAppsBackend`** folder of your Codespace or your Student resources location on your local workstation.  The file will be populated with the Azure resource endpoints and access keys from your Azure lab environment.

#### Setup App Backend and Frontend

Now that the Azure resources to support the hack's sample application have been deployed, you will setup and run both the backend and frontend components in your development environment.  These components will run in your development environment (GitHub Codespace OR local workstation) throughout the duration of the hack as you work on the challenges.

Here are some things to know about the developer environment:
- Once you start each component, it will hold the Terminal session while the component is running.
- Therefore, each component will require its own Terminal session in VS Code.
- If you are using GitHub Codespaces and the Codespace times out while you are hacking, you will need to re-run the steps here to restart each component.

##### Setup App Backend

The sample application's Backend is implemented as an Azure Function. Azure Functions can be run in a local developer environment for testing before eventual deployment into Azure.  For this hack, you will run the application's Backend function code in your developer environment without publishing it to Azure.

In a Terminal session in VSCode, navigate to the `/ContosoAIAppsBackend` folder and Start up the Backend function app by running the following commands:

```
cd ContosoAIAppsBackend
pip install -r requirements.txt
func start 
```

##### Setup App Frontend

The sample application's Frontend is implemented as an Angular web application. For this hack, you will only run the application's Frontend in your development environment without publishing it to Azure.  

Open another Terminal session in VScode and then navigate into the `/ContosoAIAppsFrontend` folder. Install the application dependencies and start the Frontend by running the following commands:

```
# Navigates into the folder 
cd ContosoAIAppsFrontend

# Installs the node packages required for the frontend
npm install

# Starts up the web application on your local machine
npm start
```

**NOTE:** The Frontend application is configured to connect to the Backend function's URL via a setting in the `/ContosoAIAppsFrontend/src/environments/environment.ts` file. If your Backend function app is running on a different port or machine, please update the `environment.ts` config file accordingly

Open another terminal session in VSCode so that you can continue the rest of the challenges. The terminal sessions you opened to run the Frontend and Backend should remain running in the background. 

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that you have a bash shell with the Azure CLI available.
- Verify that you have deployed the following resources in Azure:

  - Azure OpenAI Service
  - Azure Cognitive Search
  - Two Azure Storage Accounts with Azure Blob Storage
  - Azure Cosmos DB service with databases and containers
  - Azure Service Bus with at least one queue set up
  - Azure Redis Cache Instance
  - Azure Document Intelligence Service (formerly Azure Form Recognizer)
 
Your Azure Function Backend and Front End applications should be up and running and reachable via HTTP (Browser)

You should also be able to ask Murphy and Priscilla for their name from the front-end and they should respond correctly with the correct name configured in the app's system prompts. The other assistants will not currently respond correctly and will be fixed in a later challenge.
