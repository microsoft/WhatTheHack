# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Azure Open AI Apps What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

This hack can be run where an Azure environment is provided in lab, or where the student deploys the hack's Azure resources into their own Azure subscription. 

## Select Your Path!
**Attention Attendee:**  Your coach will advise you if there is a lab environment provided. If a lab environment is provided, THANK your coaches as they have saved you a few setup steps and a bunch of time. If not, don't worry, we have you covered with all the steps to deploy the Azure resources needed into your own Azure subscription.
