## Notes & Guidance

There are lot of opportunities for the students to get things wrong in this Challenge. Make sure they use the correct names for fields, model, and document type. These are in the document-intelligence-dictionary.json. Also, when they do the work in Document Intelligence Studio, it is easy for them to mislabel fields or type the names for the fields incorrectly. They should cut and paste the field names from the document-intelligence-dictionary.json. 

The signature field appears to only work by drawing a region and then selecting a field. 

Checkboxes sometimes can be finicky about how they are clicked and then assigned to a field. If you get an error, make sure you click the checkbox itself and not the check mark/X within the checkbox. 

If the model training fails, the student should retry the model training. Sometimes the Document Intelligence service might be under load and the training may just fail.
