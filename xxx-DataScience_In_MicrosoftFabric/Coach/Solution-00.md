# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO! - Coach's Guide 

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Data Science In Microsoft Fabric What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

## Common Prerequisites

We have compiled a list of common tools and software that will come in handy to complete most What The Hack Azure-based hacks!

You might not need all of them for the hack you are participating in. However, if you work with Azure on a regular basis, these are all things you should consider having in your toolbox.

- [Managing Cloud Resources](../Student/000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#managing-cloud-resources)
  - [Azure Portal](../Student/000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-portal)
  - [Azure CLI](../Student/000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-cli)

  - [Azure Cloud Shell](../Student/000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-cloud-shell)
- [Azure Storage Explorer](../Student/000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-storage-explorer)

## Description

Now that you have the common pre-requisites installed on your workstation, there are prerequisites specifc to this hack.

Your coach will provide you with a Resources.zip file that contains resources you will need to complete the hack. This folder contains the data that you will use during this hack. Please download and unzip the folder.

Now, head to the Azure portal. You will need to deploy an Azure Storage Account. You can do so by using the following Azure Cloud Shell commands. Open a new cloud shell (top right of your screen) and enter these commands one by one: 

Create a new resource group:
- `az group create --name FabricDSWTH --location eastus`
Deploy a Storage Account:
- `az storage account create --name fabricdswth --resource-group FabricDSWTH --sku Standard_LRS `
Enable hirearchical namespace:
- 'az storage account hns-migration start --request-type upgrade --name fabricdswth`

## Success Criteria

_Success criteria goes here. The success criteria should be a list of checks so a student knows they have completed the challenge successfully. These should be things that can be demonstrated to a coach._

_The success criteria should not be a list of instructions._

_Success criteria should always start with language like: "Validate XXX..." or "Verify YYY..." or "Show ZZZ..." or "Demonstrate you understand VVV..."_

_Sample success criteria for the IoT prerequisites challenge:_

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that you have a bash shell with the Azure CLI available.
- Verify that the ARM template has deployed the following resources in Azure:
  - Azure IoT Hub
  - Virtual Network
  - Jumpbox VM

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

_Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario._

**\*Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.\*

_Sample IoT resource links:_

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Notes & Guidance

This is the only section you need to include.

Use general non-bulleted text for the beginning of a solution area for this challenge

- Then move into bullets
  - And sub-bullets and even
    - sub-sub-bullets

Break things apart with more than one bullet list

- Like this
- One
- Right
- Here
