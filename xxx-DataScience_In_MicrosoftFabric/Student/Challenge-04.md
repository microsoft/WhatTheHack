# Challenge 04 - Load the ML Model from Microsoft Fabric to Azure ML

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Pre-requisites (Optional)
- Azure ML Learning Resource Deployed.
- ML model is ready on Microsoft Fabric.

## Description

You have been tasked to deploy the machine learning model which you have trained in Microsoft Fabric to Azure ML learning for real time inference endpoint.  In this challenge, you will deploy a Fabric model to Azure Machine Learning, and repurposed a model trained in Fabric for use by applications via scalable Azure compute clusters.  The ability to export and repurpose models opens endless opportunities!

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge, please verify that :
  - ML model is ready and downloaded from Microsoft Fabric.
  - Deployed Successfully on Azure ML real endpoints.
  - Deployed model is predicting the heart failure prediction.
