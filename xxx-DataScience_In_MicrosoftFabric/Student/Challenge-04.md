# Challenge 04 - Load the ML Model from Microsoft Fabric to Azure ML

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Pre-requisites (Optional)
- Azure ML Learning Resource Deployed.
- ML model is ready on Microsoft Fabric.

## Description

You have been tasked to deploy the machine learning model which you have trained in Microsoft Fabric to Azure ML learning for real time inference endpoint.  In this challenge, you will deploy a Fabric model to Azure Machine Learning, and repurposed a model trained in Fabric for use by applications via scalable Azure compute clusters.  The ability to export and repurpose models opens endless opportunities!

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge, please verify that :
  - ML model is ready and downloaded from Microsoft Fabric.
  - Deployed Successfully on Azure ML real endpoints.
  - Deployed model is predicting the heart failure prediction.

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
