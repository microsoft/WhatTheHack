# Challenge 05 - Visualize predictions with a Power BI report

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)

## Pre-requisites 

- Batch predicated data is stored in lakehouse from previous challenge.

## Description

- You've been tasked with creating some reporting using Power BI based on the data which got batch predicted in the last challenge. In this challenge, you must create a semantic model and add measures if required and create the visualization based on it.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge, verify that:

- You have a PowerBI report displaying the data from the batch predicted table. Your report must, at a minimum, be able to identify which patients are at risk of heart failure. You must use the id field for this purpose.
