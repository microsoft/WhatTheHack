# Challenge 05 - Visualize predictions with a Power BI report

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)

## Pre-requisites 

- Batch predicated data is stored in lakehouse from previous challenge.

## Description

*You've been tasked with creating some reporting using Power BI based on the data whihc got batch predicated in the last challenge. In this challenge, 

## Success Criteria

*Success criteria goes here. The success criteria should be a list of checks so a student knows they have completed the challenge successfully. These should be things that can be demonstrated to a coach.* 

*The success criteria should not be a list of instructions.*

*Success criteria should always start with language like: "Validate XXX..." or "Verify YYY..." or "Show ZZZ..." or "Demonstrate you understand VVV..."*

*Sample success criteria for the IoT sample challenge:*

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that the IoT device boots properly after its thingamajig is configured.
- Verify that the thingamajig can connect to the mothership.
- Demonstrate that the thingamajic will not connect to the IoTProxyShip

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*

*Sample IoT resource links:*

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
