# Challenge 05 - Visualize predictions with a Power BI report

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)

## Pre-requisites 

- Batch predicated data is stored in lakehouse from previous challenge.

## Description

- You've been tasked with creating some reporting using Power BI based on the data whihc got batch predicated in the last challenge. In this challenge, you must create asemanticn model and add measures if required and create the visualization based on it.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge, verify that:

- You have a PowerBI report displaying the data from the batch predicted table.

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
