# Challenge 02 - Dynatrace Observability on AKS

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)


## Pre-requisites
- Ensure all Azure resources are provisioned from Challenge 0 , including the AKS cluster `dynatrace-azure-wth-cluster`

## Introduction

Re-hosting, also known as lift and shift, is a typical migration approach. Re-architecture and Re-platform involve breaking traditional architectures and replacing individual components with cloud services and microservices.

We have just learned how to use Dynatrace and OneAgent to gather valuable information on services, processes, and user requests. This information will help us determine which individual services or entire applications to migrate and modernize based on their business benefits. The focus here is on migrating based on feature-oriented business benefits.

### Modernizing the Sample app

As discussed earlier, the sample application is a three-tiered application comprising a frontend, backend, and database.

For our project, an alternative version of the application separates each of the backend services into individual services. By encapsulating these services into container images, we can deploy them on modern platforms such as Azure Kubernetes, as illustrated below.

## Description
### Objectives of this Challenge
- Review how the sample application went from a simple architecture to multiple services

- Install the Dynatrace Operator and sample application

-  Examine the transformed application using service flows and back traces

### Tasks
* In Azure CLI, run the following command to fetch the AKS credentials for your cluster.
    ```shell
    az aks get-credentials --name "<aks-cluster-name>" --resource-group "<resource-group-name>"
    ```
    >ðŸ’¡**Hint:**  Refer back to Azure Portal under `<lastname>-dynatrace-azure-modernize-wth` resource group for aks cluster name
* Deploy the Dynatrace Kubernetes Operator onto your AKS cluster
    - Deploy Dynatrace Operator on the AKS cluster [via cluster extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-extensions) blade. 

    >ðŸ’¡**Hint:**  To complete the above step, you will need the token and API URL you save from Challenge 0.

<!-- 
* Deploy Kubernetes Dynatrace Operator
    - Deploy Dynatrace Operator on the AKS Cluster using 7 steps of the Automated mode 
        >ðŸ’¡**Hint:** On Step 6, when you download the **dynakube.yaml**, you can use Upload/Download feature within Azure cloudshell to upload the file

-->
* Deploy sample application
    ```bash
    cd ~/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/app-scripts
    ./start-k8.sh
    ```

* Access the sample application running on Kubernetes in you browser
    >ðŸ’¡**Hint:** To get the external IP for application type the following command

        kubectl -n staging get svc        


* Review Dynatrace data for Kubernetes
    - Navigate to Kubernetes cluster utilization screen; from the navigation menu, go to **Infrastructure** and select **Kubernetes** and click on `dynatrace-azure-wth-cluster` cluster.  
        - What are the total number of CPU cores for your cluster?
        - What are the total number of workloads running on your cluster?
    - Navigate to Kubernetes workloads screen; from the navigation menu, go to **Application & Microservices** and select **Kubernetes workloads** and filter on `dynatrace-azure-wth-cluster` cluster and namespace `staging`.  
        - What is the average response time for  `frontend` workload over the last 30 minutes 
    - Navigate to the Kubernetes service screen for `frontend` workload
        >ðŸ’¡**Hint:** You can get this screen from the previous step under the Kubernetes services section.
        - What is the hostname where this workload's pod is running?
        - What labels are associated with this service under Properties and Tags section?          

* Navigate to the `order` service screen and click on `Analyze backtrace`
    - Identify the service that calls the `order` service?   

* Navigate to the `frontend` service screen running on Kubernetes and click on `View Service flow`
    - Identify three downstream services the frontend relies on?
    - Identify  the response time for `customer` service
    - Identify the throughput value for `catalog` service 

## Success Criteria

* You have successfully fetched the AKS credentials against the cluster
* You have a successfully installed the Dynatrace Operator on the AKS cluster and able to see metrics in Dynatrace UI.
* You have successfully deployed the sample app to the AKS cluster.
* You can access the sample application in your browser.
* You are able to  identify the following data in the Kubernetes screens
    -  Identify total number of CPU cores for your cluster
    - Identify total number of workloads running on your cluster
    -  Identify average response time for  `frontend` workload over the last 30 minutes
    -  Identify hostname where the workload pod is running
    -  Identify labels are associated with this frontend service under Properties and Tags section
* You have successfully identified the the service that calls the order service?
* You have successfully identified three downstream services the `frontend` service relies on, response time for `customer` database service and throughput value for `catalog` service.
