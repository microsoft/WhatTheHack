## Notes & Guidance

## Workshop Environment Reminder

If you plan to keep the workshop resources running in Azure for a few more days to come back and review the labs, please keep in mind the following things:

* Your Dynatrace Trial Environment will disabled after 14 calendar days.

## Workshop Cleanup

When you are ready to cleanup the workshop resource, run this command to remove the Azure resources and Dynatrace configuration:

```
cd ~/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/provision-scripts
./cleanup-workshop.sh
```

The start of the script output will look like this:
