## Detailed Steps

## Create the SRG

* Create a guardian
    * In Dynatrace from menu on the left, select Apps -> Site Reliability Guardian.
    * On the All Guardians overview page, select + Guardian.
    * Click on create without template. A new guardian is displayed in the editor.
    * Provide a name for the guardian: my-first-guardian
    * Add the following objective example by defining the name, a DQL, and specifying a target as well as a warning threshold.
        * Objective name: Error rate
        * Description: The error rate objective derives the number of error logs in ratio to the total number of log lines. The target is set to be less than 2% with a warning indicator at 1.5% of error logs.
        * DQL to calculate the error
            ```bash
               fetch logs
               | fieldsAdd errors = toLong(loglevel == "ERROR")
               | summarize errorRate = sum(errors)/count() *100 
            ```

        * Click on run query, select the last 1 hour to preview results of your current error rate.
    * Set thresholds for this objective:
        * Select Lower than the these numbers is good
        * Failure: 1
        * Warning: 0.4
    * Click on Create to create the guardian.
    * Click on Validate to perform a manual validation of the objective.
