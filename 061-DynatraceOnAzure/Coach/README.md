# What The Hack - Dynatrace On Azure - Coach Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the Dynatrace On Azure WhatTheHack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

This hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

This WhatTheHack provide you hands on experience on how to Monitor Azure workloads using Dynatrace.   It will show you how Dynatrace's AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud Azure environments. This hack was designed specifically for Cloud Ops Engineers, DevOps engineers, Developers, and Architects who want to expand their knowledge on Dynatrace & Azure.

The story goes that, you are new engineer that was hired to modernize a eCommerce website for company called `DTOrders`.  `DTOrders` currently has this application deployed to Azure virtual machines but  wants to containerize this application to run it on Kubernetes.  The engineer's job will first be deploy the application to Azure VM and then migrate it run on AKS Cluster.  Along the way, they'll use Dynatrace to  monitor the application on Azure VM and once migrated to AKS, compare the product functionality and how easy it is to monitor and manage your application with Dynatrace.


**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Coach Prerequisites

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. 

Please review the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any What The Hack event, including how to properly configure Microsoft Teams.

The folders are self contained challenges for the hack. You do not need to go to other resources to run the challenges. Attendee's will need a laptop, but only an Azure browser is required. All work will be done in the Azure  portal and the Azure Command Shell. If you think attendee's laptops may be locked down to the point that they can't access Azure, than having a laptop for loan will be a good idea. No special software needs to be installed though.

The original code base for the automation scripts and sample app that are used within the Challenges are located below:

- [Dynatrace Azure Workshop Scripts](https://github.com/dt-alliances-workshops/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/)
- [Sample App Code Repository](https://github.com/dt-orders)
- [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=dtdemos)


### Dynatrace Environment Setup

To successfully run this Hack, each WhatTheHack attendee will need their own Azure AD Tenant deployed.

>**Note:** If you run this Hack where attendees share the same Azure AD Tenant, only the first attendee will be able to deploy the Dynatrace Trial environment via the Marketplace in Challenge0.  The rest of the attendees will get an error.


### Student Resources

Students will download the scripts from a github repo via the Git clone in the Azure Cloud shell

Always refer students to the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth) for the student guide: [https://aka.ms/wth](https://aka.ms/wth)

>**Note:** Students should **not** be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. The student guide does **NOT** have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub.

### Additional Coach Prerequisites (Optional)

- Coach must validate if the [Dynatrace Azure Workshop Github repo](https://github.com/dt-alliances-workshops/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/) is accessible. 

- If Github repo is inaccessible, please open up a issue within the WhatTheHack repo.  

## Azure Requirements

This hack requires students to have access to an Azure subscription where they can create and consume Azure resources. 

In addition to that, if this hack is run within the same Company/Organization, each hack attendee will need their own Azure/Entra AD tenant.  The free trial tenant for Dynatrace via Marketplace, [Azure Native Dynatrace Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps/dynatrace.dynatrace_portal_integration?tab=Overview), limits customers to be able to  create 1 trial tenant for their Organization. Therefore, each attendee will need an [Azure Pass codes](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) to successfully run this hack.  With Azure Pass codes, each attendee will get their own Azure AD/Entra tenant.  

These Azure requirements should be shared with a stakeholder in the organization that will be providing the Azure subscription(s) that will be used by the students.

- Attendees should have the “Azure account administrator” (or "Owner") role on the Azure subscription in order setup Azure Monitor metrics integration. 

- Each student will spin up the following resources in Azure:
    - 4 x 2 vCPUs VMs for the AKS cluster + 1 Public IPs    
    - 1 x 2 vCPUs VMs for sample monolith application    
    - 1 PIP for the Dynatrace Orders website on Monolith
    - 1 PIP for Dynatrace Orders website on AKS    
    - Total: 7 vCPU + 3 Public IPs per student

>**Note**
> - Azure resources that will be consumed by a student implementing the hack's challenges
> - Azure permissions required by a student to complete the hack's challenges.
