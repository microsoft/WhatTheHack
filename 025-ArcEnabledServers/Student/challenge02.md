# What the Hack: Azure Arc enabled servers 

## Challenge 2 â€“ Policy for Azure Arc connected servers
[Back](challenge01.md) - [Home](../readme.md) - [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge you deployed a server somewhere other than Azure, and then enabled it as an Azure resource by deploying the Azure Arc Connected Machine agent. Now that you have a server connected to Azure, we can start to use Azure to manage and govern this server. One of the primary ways we can do this is by using [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview). By using Policy, we can automatically perform management tasks on Azure resources such as creating [tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources) or using [data collection rules (DCRs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview) to send metrics to a [Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/tutorial-resource-logs).

### Challenge

1. Assign a policy that adds a resource tag to all resources in the resource group where your Azure Arc connected servers are located.

2. Create a suitable Log Analytics workspace to use with your Azure Arc resources. Make sure it is in the same region as your Azure Arc resources to avoid egress charges.

3. Assign a policy that automatically deploys the Azure Monitor agent to Azure Arc connected servers if they do not already have the agent.

4. Create an Azure Monitor Data Collection Rule to collect performance metrics of the Arc connected servers.

5. Assign a policy that configures the Data Collection Rule to the connected servers.

### Success Criteria

1. Azure Arc connected servers should have a tag applied by the policy you created in Challenge #1. 

2. Azure Arc connected servers should have the Azure Monitor agent deployed and working.

3. You can use the Log Analytics workspace to query performance metrics about your Azure Arc connected machine.
