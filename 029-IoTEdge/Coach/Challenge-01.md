**[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)


## Success Criteria
Verify challengers have performed the following:

1. IoT Hub created
1. IoT Edge Device Endpoint created in the hub
1. Ability to show what the device connection string is
1. Provisioning a 'virtual' IoT Edge Device1. Participants should have both IoT hub and devices deployed.  There are many ways to create an edge device on a virtual machine.  Review the following options to help guide students if needed.
