# Challenge 6: Private Endpoint

[< Previous Challenge](./05-online-cutover-validation.md) - **[Home](./README.md)**  - [Next Challenge >](./07-replication.md)

## Coach Tips

* If the attendee has trouble with private endpoint working with the Pizzeria application, make sure they check the logs. It's common for the dataSourceURL, username, or password to be misconfigured. 
* This challenge will not work if the attendee is using the [Basic tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-data-access-security-private-link).
