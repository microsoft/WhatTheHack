# What The Hack - Azure Monitoring

## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Azure Monitoring Hack of What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

Also remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](https://github.com/jamasten/WhatTheHack/tree/master/007-AzureMonitoring/Coach/Guides) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge.
