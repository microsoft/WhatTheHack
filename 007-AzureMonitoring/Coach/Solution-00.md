## Notes & Guidance

Biggest issues we have seen when deploying the workshop are around compute quotas, changing the region to one that does not support the Azure Monitor preview, not having contributor role membership to the subscription and local machine issues.  If you run into a student who cannot seem to get her or his computer working with the Azure CLI, have them use the Azure Cloud Shell.  Remember to copy up the ARM Bicep template and parameters Bicep files before kicking off the deployment.

We highly recommend your students make sure they have an Azure Subscription and have contributor role access before day one of the hack.  

The deployment takes around 25 minutes to finish. Suggest to your students that they start reading the Challenge 1 Introduction, Instructions, and Learning resources while it runs.
