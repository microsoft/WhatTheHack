## Notes & Guidance

In this challenge you will dig into table partitioning strategy and its impact on performance.
You will also get a deeper understanding about Columnstore Indexes behavior

**Learning objectives:**

- Deep understanding in Columnstore Index health and how they heavily affect performance
- Beeing able to identify unhealthy Columnstore indexes


## Table Partitioning â€“ Clustered columnstore health check
