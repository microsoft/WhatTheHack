--This is only for Dedicated SQL Pool with NO workspace

//Getting all queries using the same table
AzureDiagnostics 
| where Category == "ExecRequests" and Label_s != "health_checker"
| where Command_s contains "FactInternetSales" 
| order by StartTime_t desc 

//getting queries with specific Label
AzureDiagnostics 
| where Category == "ExecRequests" and Label_s != "health_checker"
| where Label_s == "Not Partitioned Table"
