## Notes & Guidance

- Actions typically need to run once before they appear as an option for branch protections
- Because GHAS is built on GitHub Actions, you may want to briefly explain GitHub actions to the team
- Feel free to talk about different aspects of CI/CD with the team
- Ensure the team **DOES NOT** merge the PR
