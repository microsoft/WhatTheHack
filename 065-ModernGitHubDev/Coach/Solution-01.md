# Challenge 01 - Configure Your Development Environment - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-00.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- Students **do not** need to install any resources on their local system. The challenge uses Codespaces, which is a cloud-based development container.
- Rebuilding the container after it's been configured for the project may take several minutes. Highlight how [prebuilds](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces) can ensure a Codespace is available for developers within seconds.
- Ensure attendees have created the secret for Codespaces for `MONGODB_URI`
- Ensure the features are added for **GitHub CLI**, **Azure CLI** and **MongoDB**
