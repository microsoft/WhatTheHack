# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Modern Development and DevOps with GitHub What The Hack. Over the next series of challenges you'll create a new repository for the source code, configure some common DevOps processes, and write some code. But before we get started, let's make sure we've got everything setup.

## Prerequisites

During this hack, you will be using features which will allow you to code and contribute to the project without having to install tools locally. As a result, you'll only need to ensure you have the following:

<!-- If you are editing this template manually, be aware that these links are only designed to work if this Markdown file is in the /xxx-HackName/Student/ folder of your hack. -->

- [GitHub Account](https://github.com) for developing on and managing the project.
- [Azure Subscription](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-subscription) for deploying the application.

## Description

The shelter has an application already created by a vendor they wish to use as the foundation for their website. The project currently resides on GitHub as a template. The first step is for you to obtain the source code and create a repository on GitHub to maintain a separate copy. The changes you make will **not** be merged back to the original application.

The project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/) project using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). It is based on the [Next.js MongoDB example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb).

> **IMPORTANT**: This hackathon does **not** require experience with JavaScript, React or Next.js.

## Success Criteria

- You have a copy of the existing application in a repository in your account/organization
- You have **not** created a fork of the existing repository
