# Challenge 03 - Create Resources - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-02.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-04.md)

## Notes & Guidance

See the bottom of this page for instructions on generating a CLI script using Copilot or ChatGPT.

## Challenge 03 Accelerator

By default, Challenge 03 involves having the students doing a lot of discovery by navigating the Azure Portal to deploy all of the PaaS resources that make up the TollBooth application's Serverless architecture.  This is a worthy challenge, but can be time consuming.

If the organization you are delivering this hack to has limited time, you may wish to "accelerate" students through this challenge by providing them with an automation script & bicep template that pre-deploys all of the Azure resources required by Challenge 3.

There is a "hidden" Challenge 03 Accelerator page in the Student guide. You can point students at this page by having them add an "A" to the end of the Challenge 03 link in the Student Guide:
- `https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/015-Serverless/Student/Challenge-03A.html`

This page has abbreviated challenge tasks that include having the students:
- Figure out how to view the secrets in Key Vault
- Identify how the Function Apps have access to the Key Vault
- Validate there are values in each of the Key Vault secrets

To use the Challenge 03 Accelerator when delivering the hack, you have two options:
1. Provide the automation script to the students for them to run on their own.
2. Provide the automation script to an Azure Lab provider (like [Spektra Systems](https://spektrasystems.com/)) and have the lab provider pre-deploy it to lab environments ahead of the hack.

Whether you provide the automation script to the students or a lab provider, you can use the following instructions to deploy it:

1. Navigate to the [`/Coach/Solutions/Challenge-03-Accelerator`](Solutions/Challenge-03-Accelerator) folder in this repo.
2. Download the `deployAzureResources.sh` & `main.bicep` files to your local workstation and ensure they are both in the same folder.
    - **NOTE:** If you are providing the script & bicep template to the students, you should package them to a ZIP file and distribute directly to the students.  You should NOT direct students to the What The Hack repo link here in the Coach Guide!
4. Open a Terminal/WSL with Bash shell to the folder where you downloaded the files.
5. Make the `deployAzureResources.sh` file executable with the following command: `chmod +x deployAzureResources.sh`
6. Log into the Azure CLI: `az login`
7. Run the deployment script: `./deployAzureResources.sh`

While the script is running, you can monitor its progress in the Azure Portal by navigating to the Resource Group `wth-serverless-rg` and checking the `Deployments` pane.

For education purposes, there's also a script `after-accelerator-ch04-06.sh` with the CLI instructions to complete challenges 4 to 6 after running the 03-Accelerator

**NOTE:** If you plan to deploy these resources to different resource groups in a shared subscription, you must modify the `RGName` value in the `deployAzureResources.sh` script for each deployment so you don't collide on the same Resource Group.

## May 2024 Serverless Lab at MS Build

For MS Build conference on May 2024 we created a shorter version of this WTH, automating most of challenge 01 to 07, removing challenge 08 altogether, so it can be completed in a couple hours (starting from a codespace with the TODO code already replaced and all Azure resources pre-created). Note that the lab have different numbered activities (lab 1 to 5). Coaches can look at the instructions and the Bicep code in the Coach/Solutions/may2024-lab-msbuild folder, as it has less things to configure, so it can be used for training the Coaches or to prepare a custom version of this WTH. Note that this folder won't be updated by WTH maintainers going forward (so expect the code to become outdated in the future)

## Step by Step Instructions

If you wish to deploy the resources manually and stay ahead of the students, you can follow the step-by-step instructions here, along with some references to the documentation that explains further details.

### Task 5: Create the Cognitive Services API

Look in the portal for Azure AI services, then Computer vision. Select S1 pricing, leave all other options as default. Learn more in the [Azure AI Vision doc page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/)

### Task 6: Create the Keyvault secrets

Create a KeyVault with RBAC permission model (from the Access Configuration menu), everything else by default. Add yourself as KeyVault administrator from the Access Control (IAM) menu. If soft-delete is enabled, that keyvault won't be removed when deleted, so that name cannot be used again (this may affect those Coaches using the CLI for a 2nd time) until manually purged.

Here's a table with example values for the secrets, redacted (to ensure the right syntax). 
**NOTE FOR LINUX/WSL USERS**: If there's a \r or \n in the value, weird things will happen in the code. Ensure you just copy&paste the values from the portal.

| **Secret** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| `blobStorageConnection` | `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=wthserverless2014xxz;AccountKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqeyH6w==;BlobEndpoint=https://wthserverless2014xxz.blob.core.windows.net/;FileEndpoint=https://wthserverless2014xxz.file.core.windows.net/;QueueEndpoint=https://wthserverless2014xxz.queue.core.windows.net/;TableEndpoint=https://wthserverless2014xxz.table.core.windows.net/` |
| `computerVisionApiKey` | `cXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0b` |
| `cosmosDBAuthorizationKey` | `vxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQQ==` |
| `cosmosDBConnectionString` | `AccountEndpoint=https://wth-serverless-cosmosdbxx.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=vxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ==;` |
| `eventGridTopicKey` | `Pxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8=` |

## Copilot prompt for Azure CLI

**NOTE:** If you'd like, you can try using the Copilot prompt below to generate an Azure CLI script that can deploy the resources as described above. Your results may vary and you should check any generated script to validate it would do what is specified above.

Using Microsoft Copilot, ask in Precise mode: 
```
Give me the Azure CLI commands to execute the following actions. Use variables for all the parameters:  

- Create a resource group  

- Create an Azure Cosmos DB account with the following characteristics: API type Core (SQL), Disable Geo-redundency and multi-region writes.  

- Create an Azure Cosmos DB SQL database with Database Name `LicensePlates` .  

- Create a container inside the Cosmos DB account, in the Database `LicensePlates` (do not provision database throughput) and Container ID "Processed", Partition key : "`/licensePlateText`"  

- Create a similar second container, Database `LicensePlates`, Container ID "NeedsManualReview", Partition key : "/fileName"  

- Create a storage account, name INIT, Create two blob containers "images" and "export"  

- Create an Event Grid Topic (leave schema as Event Grid Schema)  

- Create a Computer Vision API service (S1 pricing tier)  

- Create a Key Vault, Pricing Tier Standard 

Get the Computer Vision Api Key and put it in a variable named computerVisionApiKey  

Get the eventGrid Topic Key and put it in a variable named eventGridTopicKey  

Get the CosmosDB Authorization Key and put it in a variable named cosmosDBAuthorizationKey 

Get the blob Storage Connection string to the storage account and put it in a variable named Connection 

Create 4 secrets with their respective values: computerVisionApiKey , eventGridTopicKey , cosmosDBAuthorizationKey ,blobStorageConnection. 
```
(IMPORTANT: you still have to configure the RBAC for the Function to be able to read from the Key Vault using a Managed Identity)
