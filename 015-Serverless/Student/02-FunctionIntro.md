## Introduction
Azure Functions are an integral part of a Serverless architecture.  Azure Functions allows you to run small pieces of code (called "functions") without worrying about application infrastructure. With Azure Functions, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date servers you need to keep your application running at scale.

## Success criteria

1. You are able to open your function in a browser and pass your name in the query string.  You should see a message like:
*Hello, YourName. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.*
