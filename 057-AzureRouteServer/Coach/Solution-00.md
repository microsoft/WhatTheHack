**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- Make sure that you have joined the Teams group for this track. Please ask your coach about the correct Teams channel to join.
- Ask your coach about the subscription you are going to use to fulfill the challenges
- Install the recommended toolset, using one of these:
  - The PowerShell way (same tooling for Windows, Linux or Mac):
    - [PowerShell core (7.x)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)
    - [Azure PowerShell modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the Windows PowerShell ISE might be an option here for Windows users, but VS Code is far, far better
    - [Visual Studio Code PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell)
  - The Azure CLI way:
    - [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10), if you are running Windows and want to install the Azure CLI under a Linux shell like bash or zsh
    - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the Windows PowerShell ISE might be an option here for Windows users, but VS Code is far, far better
    - [VScode Azure CLI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli)
  - The Azure Portal way: not really recommended, but you can still use the portal to fulfill most of the challenges.You may have to do the same task multiple times across the challenges :)

**NOTE:** You can use Azure PowerShell and CLI on the Azure Cloud Shell, but running the commands within Visual Studio Code will give you a much better experience
