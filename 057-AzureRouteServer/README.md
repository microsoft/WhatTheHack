# What The Hack - Azure Route Server

## Introduction

This hack builds on a traditional Hub and Spoke topology and introduces Azure Route Server. Students will engage in an increasingly adopted technique that provides the ability to exchange routes more dynamically. Students will get familiar with basic trending implementations of Azure Route Server that have been adopted in the industry.  

## Learning Objectives

- BGP Review
- Understand how Azure Route Server leverages BGP to enable Dynamic Routing
- Understand Azure Route Server within a Hub and Spoke Topology with a central Network Virtual Appliance.  
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with On-Premises 
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with On-Premises and SDWAN. 
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with High Availability.
