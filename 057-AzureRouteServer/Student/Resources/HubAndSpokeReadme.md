The script you will be running will create the following

- Hub and Spoke Topology 
- No On Premises environment will be deployed. That will be done on Challenge 1
- Local Network Gateway will have to be done later since we do not have the "On Premises" components at this stage.
- Username: azureuser; Password: Msft123Msft123 for all Ubuntu Linux VMs
- No Route Server or Central NVA will be deployed yet.
