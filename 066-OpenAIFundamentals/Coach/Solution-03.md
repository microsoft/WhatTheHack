## Notes & Guidance

There are three important parts to Challenge-03. The students will go through each of these notebooks in the `/Student/Resources/Notebooks` folder:

- [`CH-03-A-Grounding.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-03-A-Grounding.ipynb)
- [`CH-03-B-Chunking.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-03-B-Chunking.ipynb)
- [`CH-03-C-Embeddings.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-03-C-Embeddings.ipynb)

Each of the notebooks above are filled with code cells. They will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. 

In the `/Solutions` folder, you will see the same notebooks but with the solutions:
- [`CH-03-A-Grounding-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-03-A-Grounding-Solution.ipynb)
- [`CH-03-B-Chunking-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-03-B-Chunking-Solution.ipynb)
- [`CH-03-C-Embeddings-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-03-C-Embeddings-Solution.ipynb)

The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side.
