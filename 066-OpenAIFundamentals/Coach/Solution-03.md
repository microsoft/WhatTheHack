[< Previous Solution](./Solution-02.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-04.md)

## Notes & Guidance

There are three important parts to Challenge-03. The students will go through each of these notebooks. 
- `CH-03-A-Grounding.ipynb`
- `CH-03-B-Chunking.ipynb`
- `CH-03-C-Embeddings.ipynb`

Each of the notebooks above are filled with code cells. They will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. In the `/Solutions` folder, you will see the same notebooks but with the solutions. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side.
