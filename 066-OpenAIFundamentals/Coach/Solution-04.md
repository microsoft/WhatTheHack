[< Previous Solution](./Solution-03.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-05.md)

## Notes & Guidance

There are three important parts to Challenge-04. The students will go through each of these notebooks in the `/Student/Resources/Notebooks` folder: 
- [`CH-04-A-RAG_for_structured_data.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-04-A-RAG_for_structured_data.ipynb)
- [`CH-04-B-RAG_for_unstructured_data.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-04-B-RAG_for_unstructured_data.ipynb)

Challenge-04 has no required tasks. There is not an accompanying Solution Notebook for this Challenge.

The Challenge-04 Notebook consists of code cells for students to run. The purpose is to expose students to developing best practices from observing existing tools and implementation, both 1st- and 3rd-party. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see.
