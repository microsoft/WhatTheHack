# Challenge 01 - Prompt Engineering - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-00.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance
There are 3 sections to Challenge-01: 
- Parameter Experimentation
- System Message Engineering
- Iterative Prompting Principles.

The students will go through each section of this notebook in the `/Student/Resources/Notebooks` folder:
- [`CH-01-PromptEngineering.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-01-PromptEngineering.ipynb)
  
The notebook above is filled with code cells. Students will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. 

In the `/Solutions` folder, you will see the same notebook but with the solutions:
- [`CH-01-PromptEngineering-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-01-PromptEngineering-Solution.ipynb)

The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side. 

- There is not a specific correct answer to the student challenges, students should be able to identify the improved results after applying prompt engineering techniques.
- Couches could help students with the code structure for response generation, including a for-loop, for example. So that students could focus more on experimenting with prompts.
