## Notes & Guidance

This challenge is OPTIONAL.

There are 2 sections to Challenge-02: 
- Model Comparison Overview
- Implementation.

The students will go through each section of this notebook in the `/Student/Resources/Notebooks` folder:
- [`CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb)
  
The notebook above is filled with code cells. Students will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. 

In the `/Solutions` folder, you will see the same notebook but with the solutions:
- [`CH-02-ModelComparison-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-02-ModelComparison-Solution.ipynb)

The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side. 

- Students can take CH1 as a reference for prompt engineering
- The model comparison chart does not have a specific correct answer. Students can put what they find in the chart.
- Coaches should ask students which model they would choose for each challenge and the reasons of choosing the model.
