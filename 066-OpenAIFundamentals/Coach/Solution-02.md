## Notes & Guidance

There are 3 sections to Challenge-02: 
- Model Discovery
- Model Benchmarking
- Prompt Flow

For Model Discovery and Model Benchmarking, the students will be comparing different models from the Model Catalog. The goal is for them to explore the model catalog and the model benchmarking tool. There is no right or wrong answer. Coaches should ask students which models look like a good pick for the task and why.

<!--- 
The students will go through each section of this notebook in the `/Student/Resources/Notebooks` folder:
- [`CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb`](../Student/Resources/Notebooks/CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb)
  
The notebook above is filled with code cells. Students will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. 

In the `/Solutions` folder, you will see the same notebook but with the solutions:
- [`CH-02-ModelComparison-Solution.ipynb`](./Solutions/CH-02-ModelComparison-Solution.ipynb)

The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side. 

- Students can take CH1 as a reference for prompt engineering
- The model comparison chart does not have a specific correct answer. Students can put what they find in the chart.
- Coaches should ask students which model they would choose for each challenge and the reasons of choosing the model.
