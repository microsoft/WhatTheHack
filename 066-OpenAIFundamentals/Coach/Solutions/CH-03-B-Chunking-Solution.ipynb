    "In this challenge, you will walk through the concepts of tokens and chunking. In the previous notebook (CH-03-A-Grounding), we were able to provide some additional context to ground the model. Is there a limit to the amount of additional context we can provide the model? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. A limit exists for the number of tokens that are allowed in the input and the output combined based on the model being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are tokens? Tokens are a representation of how the Azure OpenAI models process text. They are words or just chunks of characters. Let's look at the total number of tokens in the response we got back from the first notebook in CH-03. There are many ways to calculate tokens. In this challenge, we will take a look at the tiktoken library to count the tokens."
