    "## 1. Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding is a technique used when you want the model to return reliable answers to a given question. Often times, the GPT models will need additional context to provide a response that does not hallucinate, otherwise known as giving false responses. Remember that these GPT models have only been trained with data up to September 2021. In addition, the models have not been trained with use-case specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of methods to go about grounding. In this scenario, we will focus mainly on basic grounding within the prompt. In challenge four, you will see other applications of grounding by using an external knowledge base and implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG technique.\n",

    "To understanding the basics of grounding and its benefits, the notebook will walk you through an example. Below is the scenario we will incorporate.\n",
