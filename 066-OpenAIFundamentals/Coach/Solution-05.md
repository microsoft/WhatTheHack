# Challenge 05 - Responsible AI - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-04.md) - **[Home](./README.md)**
## Notes & Guidance

Challenge-05 has one optional student task and no required tasks. Consequently, there is not an accompanying Solution Notebook for this Challenge.

The Challenge-05 Notebook consists of code cells for students to run. The purpose is to expose students to developing best practices from observing existing tools and implementation, both 1st- and 3rd-party. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. 

Note that the Azure OpenAI API version required for Challenge-05 differs from that in the earlier Challenges. This is due to utilizing the Content Safety Annotations (Preview) feature. The correct API version is set in the early code cells of this Notebook but should be noted.

Due to changes to LangChain's `QAEvalChain`, we have provided a set of question-answer pairs from analyzing the original set of data. We encourage students to understand how these pairs were created using the `QAEvalChain`.

The Notebook also includes two sets of True-False questions about Content Safety for students to self-evaluate. Answers are included at the bottom of the Notebook.
