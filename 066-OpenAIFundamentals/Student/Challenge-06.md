# Challenge 06 - Agentic AI

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-05.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction

Integrating agents into an application after implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can significantly enhance user experience by providing personalized interactions and automating repetitive tasks. Additionally, agents can improve decision-making, ensure scalability, and offer real-time responses, making them ideal for complex task management and continuous improvement. In this challenge, you will learn how to use the Azure AI Agent service to build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade AI agents.

## Description

This challenge is divided into the following sections:
- [6.1 Building an AI Agent](#61-flight-agent)

For each section of this Challenge, you will work in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com). We recommend keeping the student guide and the Azure AI Foundry in two windows side by side as you work. This will also help to validate you have met the success criteria below for this challenge.


### 6.1 Flight Agent 

#### Student Task 6.1: Create a basic agent 

1. Follow [AI Agents in AI Foundry](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/step-by-step-tutorial-building-an-ai-agent-using-azure-ai-foundry/4386122) . 

Are you able to deploy one of the models listed in [Bing Knowledge Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview#setup) to ground with Bing Search? How does this change your results?


## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Articulate what an agent is and why it can be used
- Identify tools available to extend an agents capabilities

## Conclusion 
In this Challenge, you explored creating an AI Agent through the Azure AI Foundry portal. This developer friendly experience integrates with several tools, knowledge connections, and systems. As you start or continue to develop your AI applications, think about the coordination needed between different agents and their roles. What would be some important considerations with multi-agent systems when handling complex tasks?
