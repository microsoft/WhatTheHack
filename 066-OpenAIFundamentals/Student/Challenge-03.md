# Challenge 03 - Grounding, Chunking, and Embedding

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)


## Pre-requisites

* Azure Cognitive Search resource for indexing and retrieving relevant information
* Azure OpenAI service for Generative AI Models and Embedding Models
* Add required credentials of above resources in .env file
* Install the required libraries in the `requirements.txt` file via ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Introduction

When working with large language models, it is important to understand how to ground them with the right data. In addition, you will take a look at how to deal with token limits when you have a lot of data. Finally, you will experiment with embeddings. This challenge will teach you all the fundamental concepts - Grounding, Chunking, Embedding - before you see them in play in Challenge 4. Below are brief introductions to the concepts you will learn.

Grounding is a technique used when you want the model to return reliable answers to a given question.
Chunking is the process of breaking down a large document. It helps limit the amount of information we pass into the model.
An embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text.

## Description

Questions you should be able to answer by the end of the challenge:

- Why is grounding important and how can you ground a LLM model?
- What is a token limit?
- How can you deal with token limits? What are techniques of chunking?
- What do embedding help accomplish?


You will run the following three Jupyter notebooks for this challenge. You can find them in the `/Notebooks` folder of `Resources.zip` file.

* `CH-03-A-Grounding.ipynb`
* `CH-03-B-Chunking.ipynb`
* `CH-03-C-Embeddings.ipynb`
   
## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that you are able to ground a model through the system message
- Demonstrate various chunking techniques
- Demonstrate how to create embeddings
