    "## 1. Overview \n",
    "Red Teaming is a practice where a group of experts known as the red team try to probe a system to identify vulnerabilites. In the case of AI the goal of the red team is to strategically prompt the AI system to uncover any weaknesses in the model's robustness, safety, and ethical boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Red teaming includes:\n",
    "- Improved Safety: detecting harmful outputs and preventing potential harm caused by malicious users.\n",
    "- Enhance Fairness and Ethics: mitigates biases in model behavior and ensures compliance with ethical standards.\n",
    "- Better Reliability: strenghtens the ability for handling edge cases and reduces hallucination inaccuracies.\n",
    "- Transparency and Accountability: encourages documentation of known risks and supports responsible AI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Azure Red-Teaming Python library to automate the testing process. Using the library we can create a red teaming agent and connect it to a testing model. The agent will adverserially prompt the model on user chosen categories such as Violence, Sexual, Harm, Hate, and Unfairness. The given output is then scanned by the agent to ensure it is safe and outputted in JSON and TXT files."
