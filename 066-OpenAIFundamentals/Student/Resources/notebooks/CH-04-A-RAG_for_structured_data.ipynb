    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the practical application of RAG with a more manageable type of data i.e structured data such as relational data or text data stored in csv files. The main objective is to introduce a specific use case that demonstrates the utilization of Azure Cognitive Search to extract relevant documents and the power of ChatGPT to address relevant portions of the document, providing concise summaries based on user prompts. It aims to showcase how Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT capabilities can be adapted to suit your summarization needs, while also guiding you through the setup and evaluation of summarization results. This method can be customized to suit various summarization use cases and applied to diverse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook leverages **Semantic Kernel** as an orchestration framework to coordinate multiple AI services and manage the RAG workflow. Semantic Kernel provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service Management**: Centralized registration and access to Azure OpenAI services (chat completion and embeddings)\n",
    "- **Execution Orchestration**: Coordinated execution of embedding generation, similarity search, and response generation\n",
    "- **Configuration Management**: Unified handling of model parameters and execution settings\n",
    "- **Async Operations**: Efficient handling of concurrent AI service calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel acts as the central hub that orchestrates the interaction between Azure Cognitive Search for document retrieval and Azure OpenAI for embeddings and completions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Student Tasks\n",
    "Your goals for this challenge are to read through this notebook and complete the code where there is a TODO comment. Use Github Copilot to write the code! Ensure you run each code block, observe the results, and then be able to answer the questions posed in the student guide."

    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case consists of three sections:\n",
    "- Document Search - The process of extracting relevant documents based on the query from a corpus of documents.\n",
    "- Document Zone Search - The process of finding the relevant part of the document extracted from document search.\n",
    "- Downstream AI tasks such as Question Answering (aka Text summarization) - Text summarization is the process of creating summaries from large volumes of data while maintaining significant informational elements and content value.\n",
    "This use case can be useful in helping subject matter experts in finding relevant information from large document corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the drug discovery process, scientists in pharmaceutical industry read a corpus of documents to find specific information related to concepts, experiment results etc. This use case enables them to ask questions from the document corpus and the solution will come back with the succinct answer. Consequently, expediting the drug discovery process.\n",
    " \n",
    "Benefits of the solution:\n",
    "1. Shortens reading time\n",
    "2. Improves the effectiveness of searching for information\n",
    "3. Removes bias from human summarization techniques\n",
    "4. Increases bandwidth for humans to focus on more in-depth analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for document summarization be applied to any subject matter (legal, financial, journalist, medical, academic, etc) that requires long document summarization. The subject matter that this notebook is focusing on is journalistic - we will walk through news articles.   \n"

    "### Document Zone: Semantic Kernel Orchestrated Embeddings\n",
    "Now that we narrowed on a single document from our knowledge base using Azure Cognitive Search, we can dive deeper into the single document to refine our initial query to a more specific section or \"zone\" of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will utilize Semantic Kernel's orchestrated Azure OpenAI Embeddings service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Embeddings Overview**\n",
    "An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Azure OpenAI embedding models are specifically created to be good at a particular task. Similarity embeddings are good at capturing semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text. Text search embeddings help measure long documents are relevant to a short query. Code search embeddings are useful for embedding code snippets and embedding nature language search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs representing words by capturing the semantic similarities in a vector space. Therefore, we can use embeddings to if two text chunks are semantically related or similar, and inherently provide a score to assess similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cosine Similarity**\n",
    "A previously used approach to match similar documents was based on counting maximum number of common words between documents. This is flawed since as the document size increases, the overlap of common words increases even if the topics differ. Therefore cosine similarity is a better approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. This is beneficial because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure OpenAI embeddings rely on cosine similarity to compute similarity between documents and a query."

    "### **Chunking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with chunking. Why is chunking important when working with LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking helps overcome the challenges associated with processing long sequences and ensures optimal performance when working with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigating Token Limitations:** LLMs have a maximum token limit for each input sequence. If a document or input exceeds this limit, it needs to be divided into chunks that fit within the token constraints. Chunking allows the LLM to handle long documents or inputs by splitting them into multiple chunks that fall within the token limit. This ensures that the model can effectively process the entire content while adhering to the token constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory and Computational Efficiency:** LLMs are computationally expensive and require substantial memory resources to process long sequences of text. Chunking involves breaking down long documents or input into smaller, manageable chunks, allowing the LLM to process them efficiently within its memory limitations. By dividing the input into smaller parts, chunking helps avoid memory errors or performance degradation that may occur when processing lengthy sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Coherence:** Chunking helps maintain contextual coherence in the generated outputs. Instead of treating the entire input as a single sequence, breaking it into smaller chunks allows the model to capture local context more effectively. This improves the model's understanding of the relationships and dependencies within the text, leading to more coherent and meaningful generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improved Parallelism:** Chunking enables parallel processing, which is essential for optimizing the performance of LLMs. By dividing the input into chunks, multiple chunks can be processed simultaneously, taking advantage of parallel computing capabilities. This leads to faster inference times and enhances overall efficiency when working with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be leveraging a basic splitter for this notebook. However, it's important to note that there are more advanced splitters available, which may better suit your specific use case. "

    "The model used by the Azure OpenAI service is a generative completion call which uses natural language instructions to identify the task being asked and skill required – aka Prompt Engineering. Using this approach, the first part of the prompt includes natural language instructions and/or examples of the specific task desired. The model then completes the task by predicting the most probable next text. This technique is known as \"in-context\" learning. \n",

    "**Zero-shot**: In this case, no examples are provided to the model and only the task request is provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-shot**: In this case, a user includes several examples in the call prompt that demonstrate the expected answer format and content. \n",

    "**Fine-Tuning**: Fine Tuning lets you tailor models to your personal datasets. This customization step will let you get more out of the service by providing: \n",
    "-\tWith lots of data (at least 500 and above) traditional optimization techniques are used with Back Propagation to re-adjust the weights of the model – this enables higher quality results than mere zero-shot or few-shot. \n",
    "-\tA customized model improves the few-shot learning approach by training the model weights on your specific prompts and structure. This lets you achieve better results on a wider number of tasks without needing to provide examples in the prompt. The result is less text sent and fewer tokens \n"
