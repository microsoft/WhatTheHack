# What the Hack: IaC ARM-DSC Student Guide

Welcome to the Student Guide for this hackathon!

## Prerequisites

You will want to prepare your machine with the following [**Prerequisites**](./Prerequisites.md) to help complete the Challenges for this hack!

## ARM Template Challenges

You should start off with the ARM Template challenges first. The challenges build upon each other incrementally. You will start by creating a "Hello World" ARM template to get familiar with the tools & syntax.  Then you will extend your template incrementally to deploy multiple infrastructure resources in Azure.

If you don't have time to complete all of the ARM template challenges, we recommend switching gears and getting hands on with PowerShell DSC after you have successfully completed the ARM template challenge to deploy a Windows VM in Azure.

The PowerShell DSC challenges will start by having you deploy a simple DSC script. Then further incremental challenges will help you configure a Windows VM to become a File Server.

## PowerShell DSC Challenges

The PowerShell DSC challenges assume you know how to work with, and deploy, an ARM template.  If you have not worked with ARM templates before, we recommend you complete at least Challenges 1 through 5 of the [ARM Template Challenges](./armChallenges.md) first.

The PowerShell DSC challenges will start by having you deploy a simple DSC script. Then, further incremental challenges will help you configure a Windows VM to become a File Server.
