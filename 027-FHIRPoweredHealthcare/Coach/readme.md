# Event-driven FHIR Patient Search

## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the FHIR Powered Heathcare What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific coaches' guidance for each of the challenges.

Also remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off their challenge.
