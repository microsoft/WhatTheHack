# What The Hack – Microsoft Purview 

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the Microsoft Purview What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific coaches' guidance for each of the challenges. 

The hack builds loosely on top of each other in a modular way but obviously some challenges are a must for the next one to be done whereas some can be reordered or skipped too. Any dependencies will be called out in each challenge and coach guide. If you run into any problems, please open an issue so it can be looked at. 

This document provides guidance on the solution and links to files/scripts that will be used during the course of the hack.
