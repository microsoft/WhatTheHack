# What the Hack: DevOps 

## Challenge 4 â€“ Azure Pipelines: Infrastructure as Code
[Back](challenge03.md) - [Home](../readme.md) - [Next](challenge05.md)

### Introduction

Great we now have some code, now we need an environment to deploy it to. In DevOps we can automate the process of deploying the Azure Services we need with an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. Review the following article.

1. [Azure Resource Manager overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview)
2. [Create Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/how-to-create-template)


### Challenge

In Azure DevOps we can use Azure Pipelines to automate deploying our Azure infrastructure. For our application we will deploy 3 environments: Dev, Test and Prod. Each environment will consist of a Azure App Service, however all of our environments will share a single Resource Group, Azure App Service Plan, Application Insights Instance, and Azure Container Registry. NOTE: in real deployments you will likely not share all of these resources.

1. Create a release pipeline using the **Empty Job** template, call it `Infrastructure Release`
2. A release pipeline starts with an `Artifact`. In our pipeline we will be using the master branch of our Azure Repo.
3. Next lets create the first stage in our Infrastructure Release to deploy our ARM template to Dev. Name the sage `Dev`, and it should have a single `Azure Resource Group Deployment` task. 
   1. The task will ask you what Azure Subscription, Resource Group, and Resource Group Location you wish to use.
   2. The task will also ask you what Template you want to deploy. Use the `...` to pick the one in the ARM templates folder. 
   3. You will need to override many of the templates parameters, replacing the `<prefix>` part with a unique lowercase 5 letter name.
4. You should now be able to save and execute your infrastructure release pipeline successfully and see the dev environment out in Azure. 
5. If everything worked, go ahead and clone the `dev` stage two more times for `test` and `prod`.
   1. The only change you need to make in the `test` and `prod` stages is changing the webAppName template parameter to `<prefix>devops-test` and `<prefix>devops-prod` respectively. 
6. You should now be able to save and execute your infrastructure release pipeline successfully and see all three environments out in Azure. 



### Success Criteria

1. Your infrastructure release should complete without any errors and you should see all three environments out in Azure.
