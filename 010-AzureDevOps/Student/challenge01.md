2. [What features and services do I get with Azure DevOps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/services)
3. [Azure DevOps Services vs. Azure DevOps Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/about-azure-devops-services-tfs) - Just read and understand the first section that describes what offerings available, no need to dig through all the feature differences at this time, unless you are interested. 

### Challenge
