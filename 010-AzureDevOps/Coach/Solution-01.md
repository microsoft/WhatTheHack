## Notes & Guidance

- Provide access to the team across the organization.  The [hint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project) should guide them  through this.
- Creating work items for each challenge (Please note, there are multiple ways to do this, the instructions below are just one way)
    - In ADO, select "Boards" on the left hand panel, followed by "Boards" again in the expanded menu.
    - Select "New Item" which should be located in the "To Do" column.
    - Enter the name of the work item.
    - Repeat for each challenge.
- Students should be able to drag and drop the tickets on the board to other columns.
- Students can assign the ticket to another user after they are invited to the repo by opening the ticket and assigning to the user.
