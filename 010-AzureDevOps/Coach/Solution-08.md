[< Previous Solution](./Solution-07.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-09.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- RE: Outside In Availability Testing - Recommend students start here as these tests can help with data populating into application insights.

- RE: Dashboard Creation - Students can add a new tile to show data from their instance.  Select something that will show data a bit quicker such as requests to one of your web apps.  If they implemented the availability test, this should help with data populating the dashboard.

- RE: Work Item Integration - Students can create a work item from any of the end-to-end transactions found under Availability, Failures, or Performance sections.  We suggest availability as it's something already there from the previous actions.

Follow the steps inside the basics of Azure Insights integration. See [Doc App insights Get Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#get-started) for more information.  Overall the hints in the challenges should put the students on the right path.
