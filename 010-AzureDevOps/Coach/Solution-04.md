# Challenge 04 - Azure Pipelines: Continuous Integration - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-03.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-05.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- Students can create a new pipeline to perform a CI build.  They should leverage the Dot Net Core CLI task to perform the dotnet actions
- We don't want to continue from our last pipeline as we don't want to build our infrastructure at the same time as building our code.  You could have conditions but this may be too far than the students need to go

- Check the solution file as ADO pipeline solution sample [Solution-04.yaml](./Solutions/Solution-04.yaml)
