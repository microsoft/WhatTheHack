# What The Hack - Dynatrace On Azure

## Introduction

This WhatTheHack provide you hands on experience on how to Monitor Azure workloads using Dynatrace.   It will show you how Dynatrace's AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud Azure environments. By analyzing an application within Dynatrace, you'll learn how to understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and ensuring service levels.  You are now in the drivers seat for enabling modern operations for cloud native architectures! 

This hack was designed specifically for Cloud Ops Engineers, DevOps engineers, Developers, and Architects who want to expand their knowledge on Dynatrace & Azure.  However, anyone with passion around Observability is welcome!


## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be solving business problems that companies in any industry face by modernizing their legacy systems to cloud native architecture.  The new systems will be able to:

- Setup a Dynatrace environment and sample applications within Azure
- Jump in and fully analyze an application within Dynatrace
- Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.


## Challenges

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Prepare your environment to work with Azure and Dynatrace.
- Challenge 01: **[OneAgent Observability on Azure VM](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - Review the power on OneAgent.
- Challenge 02: **[Dynatrace Observability on AKS](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
	 - Deploy Dynatrace Operator on AKS cluster with a sample application and review AKS observability with Dynatrace.
- Challenge 03: **[Automated Root Cause Analysis with Davis](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
 	- Enable a problem in your sample application and walk through what Davis found.
- Challenge 04: **[Azure Monitor Metrics & Custom Dashboard](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
	 - In this challenge, you will create a custom dashboard to track Service Level Objects (SLO's)	 
- Challenge 05: **[Cleanup](Student/Challenge-05.md)**
	 - In this challenge, you will cleanup any resources you've created during the Hack
