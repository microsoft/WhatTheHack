# Challenge 04 - File contents

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Description

In this challenge let's learn about file content manipulation and discover how to count file lines, display specific lines from a file, and more.

- Display the first 10 lines of `/etc/resolv.conf`
- Display the last 5 lines of `/etc/crontab`
- Create a file named `count.log` with this content:

    One<br>
    Two<br>
    Three<br>
    Four<br>
    Five

- Use `cp` to make a backup of this file to `count.bkp`
- Use `cat` to make a backup of this file, saving as `cat-count.log`
- Display the content of `cat-count.log`, with all lines in reverse order
- Use `more` to display `/etc/selinux/semanage.conf`
- Use `ls` to find the biggest file in `/var/log`

## Success Criteria

1. Show the content of the first 10 lines of `/etc/resolv.conf`
2. Show the last 5 lines of `/etc/crontab`
3. Validate if the content of the file `count.log` was created as expected
4. Check if the file `count.bkp` was created 
5. Check if the file `cat-count.log` was created
6. Confirm if you can see the content of the file `cat-count.log` in reverse order
7. Validate if you was able to see the content of the file `/etc/selinux/semanage.conf` paged
8. Check if you can see the biggest file in `/var/log` at the top of the list
