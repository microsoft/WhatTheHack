- Display a long listing of the root directory
- Stay where you are and list the contents of your home directory (`~`)
- List all the files (including hidden files) in your home directory (`~`)
- Use a single command to create the following directory tree `~/folder1/folder2/folder3` (folder3 is a subdirectory from folder2, and folder2 is a subdirectory from folder1)
- List recursively the content of your `~` 
- Find the directories within your home folder
