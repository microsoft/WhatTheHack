# Challenge 12 - Setting up a webserver 

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-11.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-13.md)

## Description

In this challenge we will be setting up a webserver and deploy a simple PHP application into it. As a plus, you can add SSL to ensure security requirements.

- Download the sample application [from here](./resources/simple-php-app.tar.gz?raw=true) to your home directory
- Extract the content of simple-php-app.tar.gz on our home directory
- Install nginx-core
- Install php7.4-fpm
- Configure Nginx

## Success Criteria

1. Make sure you have the packages nginx-core and php7.4-fpm installed
2. Show your Nginx running properly

## Hint

If you install Ubuntu 18.04 instead of Ubuntu 20.04, the version of the php-fpm which will be installed will be 7.2 instead of 7.4. Then make sure to configure the nginx config file properly.
