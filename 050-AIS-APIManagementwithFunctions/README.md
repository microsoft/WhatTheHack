# What The Hack - Azure Integration Services - API Management with Function Apps

## Introduction
The Azure Integration Services (AIS) Hack will provide you a deep dive experience in building a solution that seamlessly connect apps to services whether hosted on premises or in the cloud.  This hack will enable participants to solve common business scenarios our customers face when building AIS from ground-up, from deploying, configuring and securing API management and its backend services. 


## Learning Objectives
In this hack, the participants will learn how to build an integration solution using API Management and Function Apps.  This involves the following:

1. Authoring Bicep templates to build API Management Service and backend APIs hosted in Function Apps
2. Creating CI/CD pipeline to deploy environment
3. Securing backend API services via OAuth
4. Securing backend API services over the VNET


## Challenges
-  Challenge 0: **[Prepare your Development Environment](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
   - Get yourself ready to build your integration solution
-  Challenge 1: **[Provision an Integration Environment](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
   - Create a bicep template that will provision a baseline integration environment.
-  Challenge 2: **[Deploy your Integration Environment](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
   - Create a CI/CD pipeline to do automated deployment of your integration environment.
-  Challenge 3: **[Create Backend API](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
   - Create backend APIs
-  Challenge 4: **[Secure Backend APIs](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
   - Securing backend APIs by configuring them in the VNET or by using OAuth 2.0 authorization
