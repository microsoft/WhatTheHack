/*  Merge the data into the fact table.   

The general guidance here would be to union all the updated rows with all the inserted rowas as a CTAS then drop the old table and rename the new table. 

This won't work because this table has a surrogate key that is auto populated, and CTAS will not preserve the identity column. 

The best way to acheive this is with an UPDATE followed by an INSERT.
