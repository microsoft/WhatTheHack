# Challenge 2: Create Incremental Load Pipelines - Coach's Guide

[< Previous Challenge](Solution-01.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance

Make sure the students review the PoC word document below as there are plenty of tips for them to use as they progress along in this challenge.  It is actually a prerequisite for this section.

*We highly suggest having them review this beforehand so it can be discussed amongst the team during this challenge.*

Also, you can expand this component to examine [Change Data Capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) deeper in Azure SQL.  It is up to you as a coach with regards to how deep you would like to get on this topic.

## Tips

*The following document was used in a Customer PoC and may be helpful with this challenge.  Just keep in mind that the scenario in the PoC was a bit different so some sections of the document may not be relevant to this challenge.*

- [SQLMI to Dedicated Pool Proof of Concept](../Student/Resources/SQLMItoDedicatedPoolProofofConcept.docx?raw=true)

*There are also some SQL scripts to help the attendees get started with inserting, updating and deleting records in the Azure SQL database to evaluate the Change Data Capture functionality and for the stored procedures needed for the SQL Dedicated Pool.  They are located in the [Resources Folder](../Student/Resources/SQL).*  

*Please distribute these to the students in a zip file in preperation for this challenge.*

*These scripts are templates and typically cannot be used "as is". However, they will help them with the structure needed to execute these commands as we would rather use this time to help the attendees understand the Incremental Copy concepts as opposed to creating insert & update SQL scripts from scratch.*
